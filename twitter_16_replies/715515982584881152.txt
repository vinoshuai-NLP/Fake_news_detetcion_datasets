@PrisonPlanet  at least they are consistent with minimum wage demands......wouldnt want to be hypocritical or anything.
@PrisonPlanet  I was planning to do it for free but now that I can get paid! #loadofbullshit #nicephotoshop
@PrisonPlanet  btw how is this any different that Super PACs? GOD BLESS CITIZENS UNITED!!! Right??!?!?!
@PrisonPlanet  Flag it.
@PrisonPlanet   @RealAlexJones   whoever created this phony craiglslist ad forgot to put a date/time for the "protesters" to show up lol
@pinkpantherTX  @PrisonPlanet  Yes of course. But they have the D after their names. Trump poses as an R and fools the #idiocracy
@PrisonPlanet  @PattonDivision  @realDonaldTrump  continues to be a job creator.
@PrisonPlanet  hey man got a link for it? I'm interested but there's no actual link
@PrisonPlanet  Same shit, different country. This stuff has been done since the beginning of time in my country - Bulgaria.
@PrisonPlanet  @RealAlexJones   Soros paid less in Ukraine http://paulcraigroberts.org/2014/02/17/us-eu-paying-ukrainian-rioters-protesters-paul-craig-roberts/â€¦
@PrisonPlanet  These people and media are despicable . So corrupt, that's why you need to vote Trump.
@PrisonPlanet  pathetic!
@PrisonPlanet  @RealAlexJones  well at least Trump is creating jobs now for these losers!
@PrisonPlanet  "open for persons with disabilities"...says it all
@PrisonPlanet  @RealAlexJones  awesome,  make money AND support a good cause!
@PrisonPlanet  Hillary's jobs program
@PrisonPlanet  I guess this is what the higher taxes r for, to fund socialist BS like this.
@PrisonPlanet   Disgusting. All you can say. Rent a picket. Make OT cash if you take a swing at someone?
@PrisonPlanet  @trackerem  these are fake. They have these fake ads w/most of the candidates. #hoax
@mzflea  @PrisonPlanet  heya girl! agree to disagree!  :)
@PrisonPlanet  @sonnSet2  I wouldn't trust anything Infowars sent out. They're about as legit as a 3 dollar bill with Trump's face on it.
@PrisonPlanet  YIKES
@PrisonPlanet  @Pjdahling  Prob skip class n get x credit too
@PrisonPlanet  unfuckingbelievable. This is sickening.
@PrisonPlanet  that just screams desperation, then those same protesters will turn violent.
@PrisonPlanet  @idawhannadoyou  @FoxNews  @CNNPolitics  @MSNBC  How about that one MSM.... Any comments! Who's first!
. @Gama06Jack  @PrisonPlanet  @FoxNews  @CNNPolitics  @MSNBC   MSM will never mention the fact these "protesters" are ppl w/no real convictions.
@PrisonPlanet  Crazy , ridiculous and outrageous. These people can't even protest on their own.$$ gets them out of their parents basements
@PrisonPlanet   I'm not gay but $15/hr is $15/hr
@PrisonPlanet  don't you love when capitalism is the collective outcome of support for a socialist dick bag? Lol #triggered
@PrisonPlanet  @ThisIsWhyTrump  Because it's so hard to create a Craigslist ad. Kinda far reaching for conspiracy. False flag attack
@PrisonPlanet  @RealAlexJones  these types of ads are more common than u think.
@Theonlykon  @PrisonPlanet  and I hope they are all trump supporters
@AnitaOHara4  @pinkpantherTX  @PrisonPlanet  Sorry I am not the #idiocracy fan of liberal Trump. #trumpTards are tiresome clueless leftists.
@PrisonPlanet  i wouldn't be surprised if it was hillary responsible for this to discredit both of them. Hmmmm!
@PrisonPlanet  @Rockprincess818  Shouldn't they be more worried about beating Hillary first?  Have to go through her to get to Trump.

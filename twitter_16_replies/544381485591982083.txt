@TroyBramston  Source from Ray Hadley shows confirmed same report of gunman claiming there are four packages around Sydney
@TroyBramston  @australian  @channeltennews  is this same as the "call" to Ray Hadley by "POI" from 10.30am? Or new info?
@Bionic_Dolphins  You based in Sydney John?
@TroyBramston  @Eagle_Vision  @channeltennews  take the shot...#snipertime
@Bionic_Dolphins  Glad he's safe anyway. Who would have imagined this.
@Bionic_Dolphins  Weson, your president is a fucking bad man. He was defaulted in paying service charge due to accountancy firm in HK
@Bionic_Dolphins  the fucking PM is a liar, admiring Japanese weapons used in WWII, he killed whales in 2013-2014 by indulging Jap
@Bionic_Dolphins  YES
@Bionic_Dolphins  @MikeCookinJapan  Very frightening terrible day feel for everyone involved & our country
@Jill_Lamb  @Bionic_Dolphins  Thoughts can only be with those terrified souls in the cafe. I was there few months back.. A total nightmare.
@Bionic_Dolphins  you are a clever, intelligent man. Who is the other guy. I forgot
@TroyBramston  @channeltennews  Is this confirmed???  @abcnews
@Bionic_Dolphins  @Jill_Lamb  Lets be positive, with fingers crossed. :(
@MikeCookinJapan  @Bionic_Dolphins  Think our police are doing exactly what they train for lot of respect for them
@Bionic_Dolphins  @Jill_Lamb  Is it just one bloke John? Sorry, I'm outside and not up to date..
@Bionic_Dolphins  @MikeCookinJapan  @Jill_Lamb  Are they still inside?
@Bionic_Dolphins  @Jill_Lamb  @MikeCookinJapan  Any more updates
@Bionic_Dolphins  @Jill_Lamb  @MikeCookinJapan  useless pricks

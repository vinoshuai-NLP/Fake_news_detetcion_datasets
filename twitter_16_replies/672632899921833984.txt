@BlissTabitha  Because Mr Obama has introduced crime as a way to run a nation by he and his party lying about everything. People think it OK!
@BlissTabitha  Possibly because Obama is a race baiting fool who encourages shit like this? #blameshannon
@BlissTabitha  @S_Hammerslag His divisiveness and failures are driving us mad...all according to plan. Blood's on his hands
@BlissTabitha  It's all the racial healing.
@BlissTabitha  Because they know the INJUSTICE Dept. will seldom if ever seek the death penalty. o has released how many terorists from Gitmo
@BlissTabitha  That certainly is "Fundamentally transforming America" just like POTUS wants.
@TheLamarckian  @BlissTabitha  blood transfusing America more like it.
@BlissTabitha  because we are precieved as weak with the pantywaist libs in office
@BlissTabitha  @DFredregill  believing Sandy Hook was the only false flag is like believing Bill Clinton had only one affair. NWO agenda
. @BlissTabitha   It's because #Obama leads by example. He is completely lawless, so his peeps know that they can act lawlessly without risk
@BlissTabitha  And Clinton's and half of W's were under the assault weapons ban, yet their's were higher than Reagan's.
@BlissTabitha  Because he is enabling  terrorist
@BlissTabitha  @pds0399  more pissed off crazies because of him...
@BlissTabitha  @instapundit  When they changed the definition and terrorist acts went up under Bush, it was Bush's fault.Now not Obama's fault
@BlissTabitha  @HeyTammyBruce  is this accurate? Can't be.
@BlissTabitha  @instapundit  graph those numbers and you'll have a real "hockey stick"
@BlissTabitha  @HeyTammyBruce  In a risk of wearing a tin foil hat to bed, it does make one wonder? Rise in social media? :/
@BlissTabitha  @HeyTammyBruce  more than all previous presidents combined.  Obviously that is what surrendering to terrorism leads to.
@BlissTabitha  @HeyTammyBruce  He preaches division and racial hatred. People are seeing "color" again. Sick of him
@BlissTabitha  @HeyTammyBruce  Pick one: Bush's fault, NRA, white privilege, cops, hurt feelings, Fox News, intolerance, Christianity, the GOP
@PereReader  @BlissTabitha  @HeyTammyBruce  You forgot the Koch Bros. Eh, maybe you ran out of 140.
@BlissTabitha  @HeyTammyBruce  Epidemic of prescription anti-depressants and less to do with politics. Interesting stat though.
@BlissTabitha  He's the Half-Mast President.
@peddoc63  @BlissTabitha    Also record gun sales(which I like)
@BlissTabitha  @peddoc63  I think mass murders are setups by omusbo so he could use them as ammo 4 gun control.
@peddoc63  @BlissTabitha  He did promise change!
@BlissTabitha  @Callisto1947  When u invite trouble it will happen. look at Obama record for 7 years he's weak  @realDonaldTrump  #Trump2016
@BlissTabitha  @plasticmoney888  Because he was born on a Tuesday.
@BlissTabitha  @ritzy_jewels  Really!!!!
@BlissTabitha  @ritzy_jewels  He is the laziest President and substitutes lecturing & repetition for intellectual curiosity.
@BlissTabitha  @TheGanttGuy  I really like that statistic. What a prat Obama is.
@GSDunbar  @BlissTabitha  certainly not the lightbringer the media believed they'd elected!
@BlissTabitha  @catsim7  Because he's exploited gaps in the social fabric and acerbated them to accrue power. That's his only skill. Sociopath
@BlissTabitha  @slewis8353  Obama is turning USA into 3rd world country on purpose so we.know how it feels
@BlissTabitha  you rock Tabitha
@BlissTabitha  @TamiDurling global warming

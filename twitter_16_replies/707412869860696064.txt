@thehill  Wow,,,,Shocking, @BlueWaterDays  @HouseCracka  @FoxBusiness  @CNNPolitics  ,,UNBELIEVEABLE,,
@thehill  @slone    Must have had a conficting tee time
@thehill  @slone  Obama didn't skip the funeralâ€”HE WASN'T INVITED!
@thehill  @slone  HE TENDS NOT TO HAVE ENOUGH ETIQUETTE TRAINING TO BE AT THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME.  CLASSLESS FOR SURE!!
@thehill  #Bachman #DoYourJob
@thehill  If you think about it, she'd probably prefer not to have that asswipe there anyway
@thehill  why is she at Trump Towers?
@thehill  Why is this a story. That woman is a wacko. Mrs Obama is attending.
@thehill   Few typical Americans are likely to attend the FrauBachmann funeral,if onlyNOTto be ASSociated w/theFringe
@thehill  He was working instead of pandering.
@thehill  Maybe he realized it would be more respectful not to be there and take any spotlight.
@thehill  Why on earth should  @POTUS  go to this funeral ??
@thehill  did #Bush attend Lady Bird Johnson's in 2007?  I don't think so.  I am tired of manufactured outrage #NancyReagan #Obama
@thehill  Mr. and Mrs. Chauncy Gardiner won't mind.
@thehill  I'm beginning to think Obama has a serious aversion to dead people.
@thehill  @_LucidHurricane  he's going to be in Austin  SXSW
@thehill  There is no one more classless than Bachmann!  Michelle WILL b there & that shows respect.  Obama has plenty 2 do.
@thehill  she wasn't a head of state- no reason for him to go
@thehill  Obama should adhere to a new standard not applicable to his predecessors. Check out  @GammaRae206 's Tweet:
@thehill
@thehill  @HomerWhite  -Yes,it was tasteless.Let's face it,it's what we've come to expect from him.He has NEVER bought dignity to the office
@thehill  it's protocol. Will u b just as critical when not 1 Republican shows up at either of their funerals? NOT

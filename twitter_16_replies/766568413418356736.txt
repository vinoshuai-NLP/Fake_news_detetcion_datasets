that's the brazil justice system.
@BBCNews  liar liar bums on fire 
that's Brazil sadly and undoubtedly that 'charity' will not be associated with the favella dwellers
@BBCNews  congrats to the US swimmers on reinforcing the young US male stereotype for the rest of the world #brainless
only 11000???should they not be asked to write a letter of apology to the Brazilian people for their callous action ??
@BBCNews  Bernie Ecclestone must feel aggrieved, it cost him £60 million to make his trial 'go away'
@BBCNews  Is #LochteMess going to contribute? #anotherrichkid
@BBCNews  Totally unacceptable! After messing up Brazil & Olympics image, he should be jailed as lesson to Americans like him.
@BBCNews  an appropriate slap on the wrist
@BBCNews  .Pozdr.j
@tvjoe12  @BBCNews  Targeted Donation! #PointAndClick  @FCN2go
that seems a tiny amount given the amount of logistical support the case would have commanded, along with legal fees.
you can keep on whining/feigning victimhood if it makes you feel proud tho
@BBCNews  corrupt much??
@BBCWorld  @BBCNews  veri gud
Маловато будет! Маловато! (С) Мужичок из мультфильма (пусть буржуи голову ломают над переводом).
@BBCNews  
@BBCNews  it is not a dispute, it is a scandal. When US swimmers lied about a robbery and then USOlympicsCommittee apologized .
I would use the term 'charity' loosely. Slush fund for someone.
@BBCNews  And Hillary Clinton pays nothing for her lies.
Hi! We're in grade 2!!
@BBCNews  Remarkable
@BBCNews  I don't know why Americans use their fame to tarnish the image of other nations.
@BBCNews  Question is though: Was it Feigen the only one at fault? How is #RyanLochte paying for consequences of #LochteGate ?
...really shameful story, especially when Brazil tried so hard to avoid trouble.
@BBCNews  Glad they got caught out. Don't give passports to dumb Yanks! Trying to ride roughshod over another country! #Disgrace
@BBCNews  over privileged git ban him from all competition and the others take him to fovella and level him to get smashed
@BBCNews  actually he's paying up for the lie Lochte made to the world.
IOC should rescind his medal for bringing the Olympic Games into disrepute, and the other 3's medals too. Disgraceful conduct
@BBCNews  Good teach them a hard lesson and Americans learn via Money only #RyanLochte should also pay same amount
@BBCNews  So einen Feigen Jimmy könnten wir nicht gebrauchen!
@BBCNews  pathetic Americans they get away after bombing countries claim immunity after killing people's it's nothing
@BBCNews  Rio got ripped off, they could've got 400 million. #Iran #LochteGate #RyanLochte #Hillary2016
: "US swimmer Jimmy Feigen to pay $11,000 to charity as part of deal to settle Brazil…" #1 in #Ireland http://toprt.com/TopRT_IE/?t=766568413418356736…
@BBCNews  that sounds fair. Ended up being an expensive party 
@BBCWorld  It is high price as it turned out to the contradictory story, it's amazing, they might kick a door of the lavatory.

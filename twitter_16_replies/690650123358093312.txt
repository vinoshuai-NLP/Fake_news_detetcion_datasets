@BBCBreaking  now Facebook, all corps, U2, Rolling Stones, all celebrities that think because employ people not need to pay tax #fairtaxtown
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  it's a start #Facebook UK shd follow suit paying only £4k 2 #HMRC last yr on revenues >£100m
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  let's hope this is the start of every Corp in the UK paying their taxes
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  that figure owed should have a few more noughts on it. how do they get away with it?
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  and the flipping rest..
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  they got away lightly then.  That'll teach them
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  any penalties and interest on late payment or the usual special treatment of exemption for the corporate Mafia
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  ..."agrees". I owe 50 quid. If HMRC would like to wine and dine me and we can discuss? I'll maybe agree to £1
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Ah, so! PR stunt, no doubt!
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  tip of the iceberg
@BBCBreaking  Google makes billions in the UK alone so where's the rest?
@BBCBreaking  they might pay it, but when it comes back to the Government re-investing that Money people need to search for it !
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Ye that should buy a strike on Syria Cameron will be pleased
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Which month was that for?
@BBCBreaking  FINALLY
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  I only wanted llyods bank to say sorry for making me forced out of my house because of cow boy builders caring bank
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews   so much for ' don't be evil'
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  will  Osbornes family are having an audit by HMRC any time soon?
@BBCBreaking  they'll never sell the  @google  OnHub here now.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  tax dodging Barstards ...get let off as they are a assume company I don't pay tax I'd get locked up
@bbcbreaking  good news
We can but hope and tbh I'm inclined to agree with you!  @AngryBilbo  @BBCBreaking  @BBCNews
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Wouldn't it be nice if the rest of us were able to "negotiate" how much tax we decide to pay.
@MatthewJBD  @MikeFratocrat  @BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  smoking raises a lot more than £5b in tax,
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  so they told hmrc how much they are going pay.? Not the actual amount they owe.
@BBCBreaking  @brokerhound  @BBCNews  about time
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  some searching questions must have been asked
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  your interview of Matt Brittin was almost as weak as the deal HMRC have agreed for a paltry £130m tax payment.
@BBCBreaking  Should read 'Google to sponsor Tory Government's next wave of bombing runs in exchange for tax write-off'
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  haha yeah! Take that, GOOGLE!
@BBCBreaking  @JimC85  @BBCNews  its a toe nail clipping but its a start. Hopefully it will be spent on the nhs rather than war.
@BoogeymanAddict  @BBCBreaking  @JimC85  @BBCNews  that's 1 day budget nationwide :-)
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  #HMRC spend that in paper advising my tax code changes every few weeks even though I'm PAYE #warpedpriorities
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  pittance!
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  That's just pish in the pool to them....
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  @MayorofLondon  I'm a virgin media engineer sub contractor. We are getting paid less then the national minimum wage
@BBCBreaking  well its a start I guess.....but time for government to close these legal loopholes
@BBCBreaking  @BBCWorld  @BBCNews  Google is a crooked Oligopoly
@BBCBreaking  Presume this is a downpayment of the full amount, and doesn't include the fine for late payment?

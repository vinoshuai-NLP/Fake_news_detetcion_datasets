@RamseyCorona  @JosefBacon  @CNN  meanwhile you sit at home&feed on words your own customized media tells you and you judge people based on tht
@RamseyCorona  @JosefBacon  @CNN  you send your troops to "help us" but they come here and they kill everyone on site bt our lives dont matter
@RamseyCorona  @JosefBacon  @CNN  and thts not enough, groups are then provided funds and weapons to attack and kill us more
@RamseyCorona  @JosefBacon  @CNN  while you sit at home in fear that theyll kill you when youre thousands of miles away and we're the ones dyin
@CNN  Well, way to go, ISIS!  Another fine mess and act of damnation you did.  Great "service" to humanity.  *thumbs down*
@RamseyCorona  @JosefBacon  @CNN  but you cant be bothered to help a few refugees who wld rather b in their homes raising families..nope
@RamseyCorona  @JosefBacon  @CNN  so please,tell me hw hardworking ou are and how yu preach abt freedom and democracy and how ALL lives matter
@CNN  They just feed off of chaos and destruction. Kind of like Satan 
@RamseyCorona  @JosefBacon  @CNN  well atleast those given the chance to prove they are... but arabs shldnt?
@RamseyCorona  @JosefBacon  @CNN  also these arabs arent just looking for jobs theyre looking to live..there's a diff. theyre at risk of dying
@RamseyCorona  @JosefBacon  @CNN  and majority would go back to their countries as soon as the threat is gone in a heartbeat.
@RamseyCorona  @JosefBacon  @CNN  france has its own ingrown terrorists. bc french gov has isolated those people, made them live in slums etc..
@RamseyCorona  @JosefBacon  @CNN  it was a french native that was the mastermind of that attack
@RamseyCorona  @JosefBacon  @CNN  yes exactly. having the ME stable lessens US power in the region and less benefits and interests.
@RamseyCorona  @JosefBacon  @CNN  this is politics my dear...its an ugly game that the people are the victims of
@RamseyCorona  @JosefBacon  @CNN  last I checked the US is willing to take 10k but theyve not even reached 4k. my country has accepted 2M
@RamseyCorona  @JosefBacon  @CNN  if everyone divides and helps it would be solved. besides it should be temporary. the war shldnt keep on..
@RamseyCorona  @JosefBacon  @CNN  its not a justification...its an explanation. The French government has created its own crazy terrorists
@RamseyCorona  @JosefBacon  @CNN  dont blame the refugees for that.
.@DinaTarhini  @RamseyCorona  @JosefBacon  @CNN  dont blame the human beings for that. #HumanCrisis
@Gregory9314  @RamseyCorona  @JosefBacon  @CNN  cash thats being spent on other useless things...like powerball for example loll
@RamseyCorona  @JosefBacon  @CNN  no my dear, you're just in denial bc you've never had someone invade your country and terrorize you.
@RamseyCorona  @JosefBacon  @CNN  you've just had to lose loved ones for the cause of politicians... but 1 life is not worth more than the rest
@RamseyCorona  @JosefBacon  @CNN  well as long as the US keeps meddling ..you're right. lets not forget the origins of ISIS and Al Qaeda.
@RamseyCorona  @JosefBacon  @CNN  besides no one thought it wld end in europe but here we are...yu never knw. maybe we'll unite vs US influence
@CNN  @Scarlettonfox #prayers #strength #positivevibes #lawdhelpusall
@CNN  interesting
@CNN  what is responsible about committing such a barbaric act?
@RamseyCorona  @JosefBacon  @CNN  dont be fooled by the cover of religion. We dont blame christianity for crusaders
@RamseyCorona  @JosefBacon  @CNN  USA has more threat and muders coming from themselves than external threat bt yu only fear externalterrorism?
@RamseyCorona  @Gregory9314  @JosefBacon  @CNN  hardworking tax payers who dont get much in return bc the gov uses it for deadly invasions
@RamseyCorona  @Gregory9314  @JosefBacon  no but ive got pple there and besides i live in the region affected by US invasions tht caused terror
@RamseyCorona  bc like i said i live where the truth is shown and known unlike americans who have these facts hidden from them to hide truth
@RamseyCorona  we hate the politics of the US and how it constantly ruins our region not the american people and culture etc unlike them...
@RamseyCorona  yes.. Facts of why these wars/invasions happen and what the troops actually do in the countries they invade
@RamseyCorona  but somehow the media says the same thing and attacks anyone who says otherwise? Your freedom is more limited than yu think
@RamseyCorona  like i said my hate isnt towards americans its towards their foreign policy..if yu think thts an agenda that proves me right..

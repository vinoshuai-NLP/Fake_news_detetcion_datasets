@nycjim  That tweet makes it sound like the town's official reasoning was that quote. Not quite accurate.
@BleacherNation  @nycjim  it wasn't even a quote according to the article but of course its reported as such...and the lemmings all jump
@nycjim  @Ez4u2say_Janis  Difficult to write satire when reality sounds like  @theonion
@nycjim  what?
@nycjim  @sgw94  WTH??? http://moby.to/euf05b
@nycjim  #asshats
“ @nycjim : North Carolina town rejects solar panels for sucking "up all the energy from the sun.” http://mashable.com/2015/12/14/town-rejects-solar-panels/#M1q.JH2JG05R… NO, REALLY. NOPE. 
@circular_timey  @nycjim  they will use their macine guns to make sure the sun doesnt disappear into solar panel hell
@nycjim  @KeithOlbermann  On point: "No reports have yet emerged as to whether science education is also "brown and dead" in Woodland."
@mcscajun  @nycjim  @KeithOlbermann  too frightening to be funny.
@nycjim  @pobguy  by this logic, we could probably lower the temp in Phoenix 15 degrees by installing a bunch of panels.
@nycjim  @KeithOlbermann  why not write about how poor the schools, people are in that part of the state versus calling them dumb?
@gotaylorgo  @nycjim  @KeithOlbermann  because these are adults...on council! Not children.
@nycjim  @KeithOlbermann  @paxt0nite  ....
@joe_reddd  @nycjim  @KeithOlbermann  sickening
@nycjim  Same thing happened when Chris Christie went sunbathing.
. @nycjim  @bannerite  Unbelievable that there are collectively that many stupid people-I don't want 2hear anymore jokes about my rain dancing!
@nycjim  OMG we need help. What else is there to say? Could not believe this. NC should send him back to school. His brain has not matured.
@nycjim  @h_quant  That os a cheap headline. One person said that crap, not the board. They also okay'd 3 solar projects, stopped the 4th.
@nycjim  I refuse to believe people can be that stupid.  Nope.  At least,  not before tea & CNN.
@nycjim  Tmk that's a VERY small town that relies a lot on farming. At some levels, it actually makes sense. If it were NYC, I'd have a prob.
@nycjim  @KeithOlbermann  dumb and dumber
@nycjim  normally, I would expect that level of ignorance from their bros from S.C. I have a feeling someone (power company) bamboozled them.
@nycjim  Maybe we SHOULD have let the south win.
@nycjim  I am scared to click on that link for fear this is real.... Oh ... My... @nchealthaccess surely not?
. @nycjim
@nycjim  @JeanneFischer33   I'm skeptical. "Local resident Bobby Mann..."   Is this a real person? This is the internet, this could be fake.
@MyassesDragon  @nycjim  Sounds http://real.to.me.
@nycjim  @bannerite
@nycjim  I just cringed in unbearable pain
@nycjim  Just when you think stupid has hit the ceiling.....words elude me
@nycjim  If this doesn't prove how the U.S education system has completely failed, I don't know what does. Sucks it's been intentionally done
@nycjim  @KeithOlbermann  Lol you can't make this shit up!

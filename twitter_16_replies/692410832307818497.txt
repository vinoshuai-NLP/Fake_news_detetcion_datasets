@mattcornell  He is the next president after Obama the destroyer. Now go and tell your neighbors. #Trump2016   @politico  @realDonaldTrump
what would be the point? @politico : Will you watch Thursdayâ€™s #GOPDebate if  @realDonaldTrump  is not on stage? @realDonaldTrump
@politico  @realDonaldTrump  debate will be about issues, not name calling or insults from the big D, what a refreshing thought
@politico  wasn't going to because  @realDonaldTrump  lowers the discourse but now I'm looking forward to it. Great opp for Rubio Christie Cruz
@politico  I am THRILLED that he will not be there to suck the oxygen out of the room. It will give the other candidates a chance to speak!
@songbirder74  @politico  Unless you were unaware that they don't like Trump, you won't learn anything new. Debate will still be 90% Trump.
@politico  @realDonaldTrump  of course, lol. How are the Rep. Going to deal with their front runner not being there... #primetime #madefortv
@politico  @realDonaldTrump  more reason to watch.
@politico  @realDonaldTrump  No
@politico  @realDonaldTrump  ...if you were planning to watch the GOP debate before Tuesday's news*
@politico  where is the option if I wasn't going to watch it if  @realDonaldTrump  was on stage or not?
@politico  @realDonaldTrump  This is a bad question, I wasn't going to watch anyway, trump or no trump.  That was not an option.
@politico  @realDonaldTrump  with or without, no. Can't take the falsehoods and posturing.Read positions and decide
@politico  @realDonaldTrump  Yes. There are still enough clowns on stage to keep us entertained.
@politico  @realDonaldTrump  set the Bar. The also-Rans aren't fresh. Until then things won't change. #TrumpTrain
@HeyThatsMyPen  @politico  @realDonaldTrump  My thoughts exactly.. When did a presidential debate become about ratings?

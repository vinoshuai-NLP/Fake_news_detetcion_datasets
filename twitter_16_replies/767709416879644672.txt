like seriously
Love Dorothy Parker. I performed a monologue of hers for my high school talent show!
@Retiario  I LOVE THAT WOMAN to bits
, LAZY
Dorothy Parker, grandmother of the sick burn. Her obituary in the  @nytimes  is well worth reading.
I can recommend this podcast on her too (if you don't know it already)
Says it all!
Dorothy Parker -- always on point!
Classic Dorothy!  (Said less intelligibly, Ryan Lochte!)
@GigiLevangie  Can be said of so many actions. Exercising and dieting come to mind.
. @nytimes  Word game from Algonquin Round Table. Define HORTICULTURE: "You can lead a whore-to-culture, but you can't make her think" DP
Wish it WASN'T true for me, but yeah...there is nothing like 'having written' but no angst greater than 'about to write'...
Forget Dorothy Parker. Where can I get that lampshade?

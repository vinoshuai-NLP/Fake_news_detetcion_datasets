@WayneDupreeShow   sorry about the expletive,  but he's  a FUCKHEAD.
@WayneDupreeShow  Amazing how Obama made time for 85 Bears to come to White House but cannot attend funerals of distinguished Americans
@WayneDupreeShow   #Disgrace
@WayneDupreeShow  gotta wonder why he's been Waldo with the last very important funerals,people remember this. His might be pretty vacant!
@WayneDupreeShow  @DSams1966  "Sharptonâ€™s Basset Hound" #snort so true
@WayneDupreeShow   they're kidding, right?!?!?
@WayneDupreeShow  It's amazing how the Dems are silent regarding this jerks lack of class. If it was a Republican they wouldn't shut up.
@waynedupreeshow  @googwaba  NO CLASS petty man
@WayneDupreeShow  I have no words
@WayneDupreeShow  @SeldenGADawgs  I see it that 0bama knows Nancy Reagan's crowd finds him despicable and He knows they're right.
@WayneDupreeShow  He hates anyone conservative, obvious
@WayneDupreeShow  The pettiness is strong in this one, use the pettiness young Obi-mama.
U shouldn't be. No sitting president goes. GWB didn't when. Ronny Reagan didn't. Conservatives are dumb.  @Tweeta1970  @WayneDupreeShow
Did you say that about GWB as well when he didn't attend funeral for former First Lady?  @KS_NE_1013  @OHellzNo  @WayneDupreeShow
@jsavite  @KS_NE_1013  @OHellzNo  @WayneDupreeShow  they don't go back that far!
@WayneDupreeShow  He's delivering keynote speech you meant. FLOTUS will attend her funeral. Half the information doesn't make your point

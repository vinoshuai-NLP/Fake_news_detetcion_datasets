@lizdom_  @cnnbrk  doesn't mean they aren't disposing of fracking water everywhere  all over ohio
@lizdom_  @cnnbrk  fracking water from PA. is being poured down every old mineshaft, well, new drill hole & leaks & sprayed on fields & roads
@cnnbrk   Why can the government poison us without repercussions, but let a cow or pig farmer have manure get into a stream and lose the farm
@cnnbrk  and the lawmakers knew as well.....stop pretending U were not complicit in this lead disaster....govt, politicians, EPA all the same

@lauderdaleagent  @voxday  what are the gun laws in New Orleans?
@lauderdaleagent  @AJDelgado13  Send the back!
@lauderdaleagent  where the hell is #BobbyJindal? It's his state?
@lauderdaleagent  @AJDelgado13  This Powdered Wig Society blog is bullsit. I suggest finding another source.
@lauderdaleagent  @AdamBaldwin  ISIS isn't bringing the war to our shores, we are. O is primarily responsible, but we will all pay the price.
@lauderdaleagent  what could possibly go wrong  @PettanPettan
@lauderdaleagent  @AdamBaldwin  unbeknownst is right NOTHING on the local news, not a peep!
@lauderdaleagent  @dexybailman  Put em back on the boat and ship them straight to Latakia.
@lauderdaleagent  @dexybailman  "Not all Muslims are terrorists!" so if only 1% of these guys are terrorists, that means we just imported 100.
@lauderdaleagent  @AdamBaldwin  Good thing New Orleans never has large crowds of people in the streets or stadiums...
@lauderdaleagent  @voxday  @jubals  If even 10% are extremists that's 1000. The only conclusion is our leaders have gone insane.
@lauderdaleagent  @voxday  Where are all the women and children? All look like healthy young men to me.
@1BeauBlake  @lauderdaleagent  @dexybailman  Well, that just bumped up the "How many terrorists did Obama just import" column.
@1BeauBlake  @lauderdaleagent  @dexybailman  And the rest are cheering them on.
@lauderdaleagent  @AdamBaldwin  Not all refugees... how many killers are amongst them?  This is a Trojan Horse.
@lauderdaleagent  I wonder how many "refugees" arrived in London so far...
@lauderdaleagent  @AdamBaldwin  @jubals  Ummmm, a google search shows that photo was taken 3 months ago in Europe... :-/

@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  @IsraelinUSA  a political correct statement. But so naïve. Salafism is a religion too u know, why attack them?
@WhiteHouse   Do you mean religion? I have faith in my incarnation. Can that be attacked? I don't think so. Religion is a belief & not facts.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  @IsraelinUSA  An attack on reason is an attack on all reason.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  @IsraelinUSA   any? Including Israeli attacks on Palestinian? Or against Muslim freedoms?
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  @IsraelinUSA  Seriously.. do you even for a moment believe the stuff spewing out?
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  @IsraelinUSA  An attack on any faith that believes in God would be an attack on all God's faithful people Amen.!
@WhiteHouse  @manishkbaid  @POTUS  @IsraelinUSA An attack on Faith is one step towards sanity!  Verifiable all around the world!
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  @IsraelinUSA  .Let's hope it includes Islam also.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  @IsraelinUSA  Islam included
@KenSchnek  @WhiteHouse  @POTUS  @IsraelinUSA  PFF... so special interests emboldened by Crony Capitalism, and gov't secrecy... nothing to you?
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  @IsraelinUSA  Except all of your attacks on Christianity.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  @IsraelinUSA  no it is not
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  @IsraelinUSA  True statement. Did u know?... In AR, it's a crime for naturists 2 worship 2gether, even on PRIVATE property

@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  @IsraelinUSA  》》》an attack on our soul!!!
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  @IsraelinUSA  yeah unless its christianity being attacked thats ok. But if you attack muslim its a hate crime
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  @IsraelinUSA   An attack on any faith is an attack on all our faiths.( Even the faith in power?)
@DaveSodman  @WhiteHouse  @POTUS  @IsraelinUSA   What a stupid statement---says more about you than anything.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  @IsraelinUSA  Limiting foreigners in OUR country is not an "attack", it is Constitutional NATIONAL SECURITY
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  @IsraelinUSA  - Don't tell us, show us. Can't hear your words, your actions are too loud! #twofaced #ALLFaithsMatter

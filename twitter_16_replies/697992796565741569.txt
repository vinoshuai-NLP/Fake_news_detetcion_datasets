@JavierNarvaezC u are lost. What's his plan? How much? Wait he needs GOP to accept that.   @ChrisKofinis  @Bernlennials  @BernieSanders
@JavierNarvaezC  @PurpleMerica  @ChrisKofinis  @Bernlennials  @BernieSanders  It's never coming.

@ChrisKofinis  @cenkuygur  @BernieSanders  Let's hope they don't change thier minds before the 20th-or have it changed for them.

@ChrisKofinis  @BernieSanders  C-Span's Twitter poll was showing Bernie ahead 74%-26%  @4400  votes. That's a given with an educated demographic
@ChrisKofinis  @BernieSanders  #FeelTheBern
@ChrisKofinis  @BernieSanders  these are really great news
@ChrisKofinis    there's a lot of ppl who r not using their MINDS!! So obvious #HRC is a mature, grown up leader. Not an infantile extremist
@ChrisKofinis  @BernieSanders  SO sick of Dem v Dem! WE THE PPL WIN EVERY debate b/c OUR DEM candidates r humans w/brains & souls unlike GOP
@MikeGallino  @ChrisKofinis  @RedwoodGirl  @BernieSanders  Of course, but people need to show up to vote at midterms!
@JavierNarvaezC  @ChrisKofinis  @BernieSanders  NV can #FeelTheBern already! #ImWithBernie
@EThornley  @nicholsonjf  @chrisFnicholson  @ChrisKofinis  Can you point me to that quote where Nate said HRC would win IA easily?
@JavierNarvaezC @prattlandia  Not to expand health care--rather, expand coverage and improve quality while reducing private and public cost.
@JavierNarvaezC  @PurpleMerica  @ChrisKofinis  @Bernlennials  @BernieSanders  we need a liberal Supreme Court so we can under their Medicaid hit
@ChrisKofinis  @ireneberns  @BernieSanders  Whoa!  Unbelievable that they admit it!
@joshuabarnhart  @sagans_spacejam  @larsloving they'd have to be clever about it. it's all about holding on to power.

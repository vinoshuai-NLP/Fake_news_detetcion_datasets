@BreakingNews  @CoryBooker  thank you also Senator Booker for your work on this issue. Please continue your fight for criminal justice reform
@BreakingNews  @eilperin  alway a friend to the criminal
@BreakingNews  @eilperin  does it make you wonder what % are black
@Wenmay316  @BreakingNews  @eilperin
@BreakingNews  @eilperin  if they did something in prison to deserve solitary that's where they should go.
@BreakingNews  @eilperin  Remember, the best way to stay out of solitary is, wait for it....... Do not commit crimes or don't get caught!
@BreakingNews   He needs to be in solitary confinement
@BreakingNews  @eilperin   now Obama starts to do all the crap he didn't have the political balls to do before.
@BreakingNews :Thank you, President Obama. Make them pay for their crimes, but treat them like humans. Kudos and God bless.
@BreakingNews  idiot
@BreakingNews  @lexcalibur100  @eilperin  100% support this. Solitary confinement is torture and torture has no place in our justice system.
@BreakingNews  This is a good move. now remove the " Try as an adult" on most of the crimes and that will be progress.
@reasor43991  @BreakingNews  you can't be serious

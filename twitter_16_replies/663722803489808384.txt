@mashable  People should go to Costa Coffee instead where they have reindeer, Santa, an elf and a snowman exactly as mentioned in the Bible.
@mashable  same enraged people are certified idiots.
@mashable  I'm sorry, what? It's proven - minimalism sells. Moreover, it's a design, not an entire campaign... #KISS

@mashable  @socialmediaund  does this hurt Starbucks image?
@mashable  I'm "enraged" that there isn't a Turkey on the cup in celebration of Thanksgiving.
@mashable  Seems like there wasn't anything else for these people to be "enraged" about so why not Starbuck's red cups?? Geeze, seriously?
@mashable  needs more festive art
@mashable  Counterpoint:
@mashable  people are the worst.
@mashable  At least the lines could be shorter.
@mashable  people should get a life !!!!
@mashable  Stop making stupid issues famous

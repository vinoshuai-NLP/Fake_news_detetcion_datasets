@TVGuide  @OnceABC  @colinodonoghue1  hook is like a drunken rapist pirate who has no remorse for anything he's done!! Some hero!!
@TVGuide  @colinodonoghue1  @OnceABC  hermoso
@TVGuide  @colinodonoghue1  @OnceABC  A pissed off boyfriend? What?? The things he said to Emma were horrible.
@Ah_SookieSookie  @TVGuide  @colinodonoghue1  @OnceABC  He's a PoS. TVGuide needs to read http://mtv.com/news/2618188/jessica-jones-kilgrave-rapist-stereotype/?utm=share_twitter…. #StopOnceUponARapeCulture
@TVGuide  @colinodonoghue1  @OnceABC  I will be so mad if I Hook and Emma don't get back together. #Emmahook
@KatieKendradee  @TVGuide  @colinodonoghue1  @OnceABC  They are still together. Just argueing like any normal couple..
@TVGuide  @OnceABC  @colinodonoghue1  good or bad Colin is a beautiful man #crushingonhook
@TVGuide  @colinodonoghue1  @OnceABC  kaboom more captain swan
@TVGuide  pissed off boyfriend or abusive partner? Bc he dings for the latter.
@BringBackNeal  @meresger1  @Ah_SookieSookie  @TVGuide  @colinodonoghue1  @OnceABC  Don't you mean abusive manipulative boyfriend?
@TVGuide  @colinodonoghue1  @OnceABC  who really gives a damn.  He is and always was horrible, and Emma deserves much better.
@TVGuide  @colinodonoghue1  @OnceABC   Surely he doesn't really think hook is a mere "pissed off boyfriend.", right?
@TVGuide  @colinodonoghue1  @OnceABC  And they are very dangerous 
@TVGuide  @colinodonoghue1  @OnceABC  "a pissed-off boyfriend" but in a larger scale don't forget he is The Dark One, so it's anger multiplie!
@TVGuide  @colinodonoghue1  @OnceABC  I still believe in their love, in CS,  they have to get rid of the Darkness!OUAT is also about hope! ;)
@TVGuide  @colinodonoghue1  @OnceABC  i want to see the fan girl behind this twitter page...
@TVGuide  @colinodonoghue1  @OnceABC  I still have faith we will have Killian back with us #CaptainSwan
.  @TVGuide  @colinodonoghue1  @OnceABC  thanks god the 'pissed off' boyfriends I had never tried to HURT me as he does with Emma! Hint: that's
.  @TVGuide  @colinodonoghue1  @OnceABC  and I like him, as a villain. As long he stays far, far away from Emma.

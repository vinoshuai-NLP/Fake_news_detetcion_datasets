I no longer shop at Target.
.. I do already .. I generally use the one with the wheelchair sign .. at least they tend to be cleaner ..
right?! Like pointing out that current Christians don't follow love thy neighbor
we'll not shop Target, they have shut us out
Will not set foot in Target.
I've walked into a Target, but never bought anything there, and don't see a reason to start.
@desiringGod  THIS IS FANTASTIC ANSWER...
one of the best quotes from this article.
haven't been to Target since.
@BobCrawfordBass  thoughts?
I have not read enough of his stuff but I like what I've read.
@desiringGod  Target who?
what?!   I shower alone.
What kind of target has people showering in it?
I shower at the gym after a long workout. So if my neighbor was there, I'd likely shower next to them, so what?

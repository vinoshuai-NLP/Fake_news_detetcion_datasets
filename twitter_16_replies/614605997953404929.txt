@AP  ...sigh. Respect the WH Obama.
@AP  Reagan said no pastel colors in our flag, but here it comes.
@AP  Love the SCOTUS ruling. But decor anything w/ rainbows & it gives it the credibility and professionalism of a box of Lucky Charms.
@AP  Terrorists killing inocents around the world and White House in rainbow colors. Obama isn't worried. No word. Tomorrow would be late..
@AP  proud day to be an American the hateful and ignorant voices can't drown out the rule of law which guarantees equal rights for all people
@AP  so much hate in the comments, you're part of the wrong side of history
@AP  Nothing against the gays. It's up to everyone!!!
@AP  It never should have happen, I've known for a longtime the dignity of the WH is lost along with it's leader
@AP  
@AP  I'm fine with the law, it's the lights that bother me. What budget did that come out of?
@AP  And I'm sure the  @WhiteHouse  will be lit in green and red in December, correct? #loveloses
@AP  DISGRACE
@AP  looks like the circus is in town. Disgrace to light up the Whitehouse that way.
@AP  These are truly sad times for Americans.  We so desperately need a real President in the WHITE HOUSE!
@AP  This President divided this nation like no other.. Cop hater, redistribution of wealth, weaken economy, weaken healthcare, job killer
@AP  this world is finished!!!! # blackpuppet

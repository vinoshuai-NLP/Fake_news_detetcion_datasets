@espn  Great he is Talking about a Black Quarter Back The HEAD  of the TEAM
@espn  Please let's just talk about the fact he is the best in the NFL and looks like he will be for years to come. Amazing athlete.
@espn  NO ONE HAS TALKED ABOUT HIM BEING BLACK
@espn  too bad no one from ESPN is reading these comments.  It's clear the public cares less about race, but the media keeps pushing garbage
@espn  I just like that he's a Black Panther.
@espn  @Frendorsedguy  #sbqbs
@espn  good lord, it's not like he's the first ever. The only one talking about it is him.
@espn  @CharlesBarkIey  I would have never even thought of the black QB angle until you said something.  I  always hope we get past that.
@espn  best thing I've heard come out of barkleys mouth in a long time, maybe all time. 
@espn  amen
@espn  Russell Wilson was in the last 2 SBs, never saw anything close to a story, why should he?
@espn  well said
@espn  nobody is.... find something else to talk about, like the game.
@espn  amen to that!
@espn  he made it that way!
@espn  thank u barkley. They always single themselves out like dude. Just play no one cares.
@espn  agree.  But the media is the driver. No one cares if Cam is black. He's just a great great QB. Period.
@espn  he is the 1 making it a black qb. he is racist yet gets a free pass. tons of talent on field, none off
@espn  yes let's make the next two weeks about black Qb's #BlackHistoryMonth
@espn  Amen Sir Charles.
@j_ferrelli  @espn     Impressed with his mental faculties.
@espn  agree we should be way that point. No one in Carolina care's about Newtons skin but if he's ready to win it all. I say yes
@espn  stop promoting Barkleys ignorance. Cam brought up his blackness nobody else.
@espn   Steven A started all that crap. He's your guy and now you want to put a message like this out after you guys pounded it all wk.REALLY
@espn  I agree 100 %
@espn  we could if the media would stop talking about it.  ESPN, I challenge you to not bring up race again when talking about Super Bowl
@espn  if heisman,ntl c'shp,degree & SB title=thug then take your shirt off,twist it around your head just like a  #thisonesfornorthcarolina
@espn  what?!  @CameronNewton  is #Black? Aren't we talkin about race by saying not 2 talk about it? Who makes these rules? #letitgo #letitflow
@espn  can we ever stop the colour difference??? I think this is getting a little tiresome! Boycott ESPN
@espn  Hey Chuck, nobody but Cam Newton made Cam Newtons greatness about Cam Newtons blackness. He's an asshat for doing so
@espn  Didn't think of it until you brought it up.
@espn  typical!!! A black not wanting it to b a black thing. Yet it's a black making it a black thing.  @CharlesBarkIey  that's sad. SMH
@espn  I hope it doesn't come down to race at all. Can Newton is just a great qb. He got where he's at with talent and hard work and high IQ.
@espn   I don't agree with his selfish lone celebrations but will stand up for his right to do it.
@espn  it is sad - can is a great athlete - they create problems - Juan, Al, Jesse, Geraldo - then Cam believes it
@espn  I agree, but I'm pretty sure the first person I even heard talk about his being a black qb was cam himself
@espn  It's only about a black QB because Cam is making it that way. The last three Super Bowls have featured black QBs.

@CBSNews  @rodimusprime  Jesus Christ, where is the fucking sense of urgency?!
@CBSNews  then why even do it after that long....CYA
@CBSNews  so sad incidents like this continues to happen. In every situation, it appears some form of agency procedures have been violated.
@CBSNews  @ShaunKing  This is normal...but should not be. Saw this in GOV owned retirement facility news piece...
@CBSNews  @ShaunKing  this is bad. A system that kills teenagers and no one takes responsibility or faces charges! Sounds like manslaughter
@CBSNews  Poor girl
@CBSNews  @ShaunKing  ahh, why so long?
Black lives don't matter in America and never have so why bother reporting on this? To rub it in?

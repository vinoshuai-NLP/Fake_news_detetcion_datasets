Congratulations ladies, especially our former U CONN Lady Huskies! #Olympicbasketballgold

Congrats to US team! & thanks to opponents too
this further proves Trump was just making up talking point when he said we (USA) dont win at anything anymore. America is ever great
Congrats to the US women's BB team!!
actually, 48, 52, 56, 60, 64, 68 is six, no? Would be 9 in a row without most controversial game in history and 13 w/o pesky wars.
don't get me wrong, women's team, rules but men's does as well
@drninaansary  Where's Don Imus when you need him?
this is an achievement that will stand the test of time. Don't think any nation can equal such feat. #USA

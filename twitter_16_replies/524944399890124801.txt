@PrideSky  @CBCAlerts  The tragedy is that we are allowing these people in to our country. Don't know what the hell you're talking about!!
@CBCAlerts  @Finlaure13  Oh no! :(
@CynleeF  @CBCAlerts  This is the second soldier killed this week by possible "terrorists" now under investigation.
@PrideSky  @CBCAlerts  I think that what they are doing around the world is "sensational". It's about time we matched it.
@PrideSky  @CBCAlerts  You should see how many have retweeted and favourited my tweet. I think I am expressing what a lot want to. Wake up!!

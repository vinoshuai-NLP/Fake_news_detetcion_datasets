. @FoxNews  reckon how far in advance they knew that ruling was coming down to be ready with those ssshhppeeessshhhullll lights???
@FoxNews  I hope those are LED lights.  We must remember our carbon footprints.
@FoxNews ; HAHAHA!! That is absolutely hilarious!
@FoxNews  how long before the ruling did our Whitehouse get prepped for that lighting?  Guess they knew something before we did?
@FoxNews  I don't agree
@FoxNews  this is awesome!
@FoxNews  This week could mark the end of America as we know it exactly what Obama wanted
@RespectTroopsUS Says a moron who supports the Mets, Jets AND Knicks...
@mratgraham  decorating the White House is degrading?  Guess we should cancel the White House Christmas decorations too then. #sorryboo
@FoxNews  this is wrong
@FoxNews  unbelievable i cant believe what this country is turning into.   Obama has tore our once great country into a laughing stock
@FoxNews  smh

@FoxNews   SICK
â€œ @FoxNews :White House aglow in colors of rainbow celebrating  SCOTUS same-sex marriage decision.Pandering using taxpayer electricity.
@FoxNews  How can such a morally bankrupt man represent such a morally bankrupt country?
@John77  @FoxNews  @megynkelly  Beautiful.
@lawgirl  except you live in America so he is your president
@FoxNews  scotus is not upholding the constitution. Remove them from power
@FoxNews  all the brain washed Fox followers. Next we need to get rid of the guns.
@FoxNews  I am about to vomit looking at that... Our Founding Fathers would be so proud.....
@FoxNews  Disgusting!
@FoxNews  An embarrassment as usual. Every day is another nightmare.
@FoxNews  wow. For real. My grandparents who fought for this country are turning in their graves. Crazy how this is our focus right now.
@FoxNews  oh my
@FoxNews  Would that be the same White House that only 3 years ago was opposed to Gay Marriage, that White House?
@FoxNews  A reminder to us as Christians that this is the result when we put party 1st instead of voting our Christian values #VoteYourValues
@FoxNews  no, that's wrong. The White House is going out of its way on this.
@FoxNews   that make me sick
@FoxNews  OMG!!! Now I've seen it all
@FoxNews  I'm as offended at this picture as if it were a Confederate flag. #SadDayforAmerica
@FoxNews  that's taking it a little too far imo
@FoxNews  how presidential!!!!
@FoxNews  why does that not surprise me?  We have a President who doesn't understand and has probably never read the Constitution

...punish his mom for not getting one. RT  @MSNBC : JUST IN: Donald Trump tells  @MSNBC : "There has to be some form of punishment" for abortion
@MSNBC  @MaddowBlog  he's getting real desperate for that Christian vote!  WOW!
@MSNBC  What is the punishment for the man who father's the child but wants nothing to do with it?
@MSNBC  what about punishment for breaking your marriage vowS to God Trump
@MSNBC  @MaddowBlog  
@MSNBC  @MaddowBlog  this is truly a disgusting statement to make.
@ginniedj1  @MSNBC  follow along now! We aren't talking about funding abortions here!
@GeminiAce  @MSNBC  there has to be a form of punishment to Trump for when he opens his trap.
@MSNBC  What if we had laws for men who left one wife for another?  Donald Trump would be guilty.  But who's judging him? God is judge of all
@MSNBC  @williamcrawley  Seriously!! How to be way out front and then start to self destruct,and this wives photo spat is just sad.
@MSNBC  "There has to be some sort of punishment for the woman." Just as long as the men who impregnate them aren't "punished." #PunishTrump
@Janice_Harper  @MSNBC  but don't you know it's all her fault for spreading her legs? 
@MSNBC  Well, just when I thought this thug of a man could not stoop any lower, his ability to surprise is almost admirable
@MSNBC  defundpp while you're at it.
@turbocoupe12  @MSNBC  Women shouldn't murder babies.
. @MSNBC  . @realDonaldTrump  Has now Proven 100% that he's not running for POTUS. https://twitter.com/MSNBC/status/715256242990505984â€¦ Women are 54% of the Electorate.
@MSNBC  @realDonaldTrump  Loose Lips sink Further Women Votes. Now at 74% unfav? Look out for 80%,coming soon! Amature Hours. @realDonaldTrump
@MSNBC  @MaddowBlog  If Trump wants female punished for illegal abortion, should male be too, maybe castrated?
@MSNBC  @MaddowBlog  Who are these deranged white men that think they can control a woman 's body? White men are delusional and sick.
@MSNBC  @NBCNightlyNews  when done illegally bc it's a crime & crime is punishable Nice try to spin #Trump #Trump2016 #StoryMode
@MSNBC  and lets remember, someone else is up in the polls... he sure knows how to change the headlines back to all trump now doesn't he
. @MSNBC  I'm sure he doesn't mean jail time or a fine. Maybe just like having to wear a scarlet "A" or something.
@MSNBC  We can't take this until November...we can't.
@MSNBC  IF IT WAS ILLEGAL IT WOULD BE AGAINST THE LAW therefore yes there should be a punishment.
@MSNBC  @MaddowBlog  I went to planned parenthood and got waterboarded #trump cause torture always works.
@MSNBC  it seems men continue to be immune from any responsibility for unwanted pregnancies. Ask yourself why?
@MSNBC  Spend some time with Trump would do it.
@MSNBC  @NBCNightlyNews  Wow! What a nut job!
@MSNBC  the ramblings of a lunatic
@MSNBC  what's the point of watching when your already talking about it b4 its even aired? Can't wait to bash the candidates b4 it aires!
@MSNBC  JUST IN HOW PHONED IN OMG WHY DON'T PEOPLE JUST  SHUT  YOU OFF FOR REAL
@MSNBC  If it's against the law and you break the law what happens
@MSNBC  the way you report it is horrible. I saw it and you take it out of context and don't say how Matthews was goading him
@MSNBC  @NBCNightlyNews  outrageous. Trump is not pro life nor is he conservative. He is a caricature from the perspective of a liberal.
@MSNBC  @outrageous74  he cant be this stupid. He just cant. It cant be humanly possible.

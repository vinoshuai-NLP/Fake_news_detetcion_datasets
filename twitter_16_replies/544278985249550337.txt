How hard is it to turn down the external sound ABC?  @mscott  @grogsgamut
@mscott  Any danger of leaving it off for good?? Expats are shut out by the ABC. Missing quality shows.
@JVTrapp06  @mscott  it's not often that people need a VPN to get into Aus!
@mscott  thanks
@mscott  Are your reporters 100% sure it is an ISIS flag? Cause that is what is being reported. #facts
@mscott  it's not working here in the uk mate
@mscott  does not seem to work on mobile in the US. What about your YouTube stream? http://youtube.com/watch?v=nvzpSvyyZis…
@mscott  Put the geoblock back on! We can have coverage once they're out. Don't broadcast police movements!
@mscott  @ztharli  the more coverage there is the more worried I am its giving these people what they want, and the situation a bad end.
@mscott  @ztharli  fingers crossed this ends well and swiftly.
Yes. This is what real news is about: “ @mscott : Geoblock lifted on #ABCNews24. Streaming coverage of the Martin Place siege in Sydney..."
@mscott  @bajopants Still blocked here (USA, iOS iView app). The geoblock lifting never works... >< Just get rid of it. Expats pay tax too!
@mscott  @vornothecat  Ta, trying that one too.  I'm on this one https://au.news.yahoo.com/video/watch/17174725/yahoo-7-live-sydney/…
@mscott  super awesome

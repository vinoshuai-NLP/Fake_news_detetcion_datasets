@BuzzFeed  I feel like this is pretty insensitive.
@BuzzFeed  why not just use the stairs
@BuzzFeed
@BuzzFeed  perhaps that lady should have heeded the warning instead of riding the escalator!
@BuzzFeed  or stairs??? Just a thought...
@BuzzFeed  ya know stairs still are the safest option
@BuzzFeed  maybe the planking craze has just arrived in china...
@BuzzFeed  @isaac  That's true
@BuzzFeed  hope the mother would rest in peace...
@buzzfeed  literally laughing out loud this sh^t so thrill!

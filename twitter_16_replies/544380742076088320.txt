@carolinemarcus  @ritapanahi  they'd be the best arms in the world to have around you after the ordeal she'd have gone through #sydneysiege
@carolinemarcus  @nswpolice  powerful shot
@carolinemarcus  FFS, she's been through enough without you plastering close ups of her face all over twitter. Leave her alone.  @tashlee
@newswithnipples  @carolinemarcus  @tashlee  amen to that!!! Bloody media. Leave the poor girl alone.
@carolinemarcus  Why is her face not obscured? Think about he family.
@aptronym  @carolinemarcus  I understand what you're saying but that would kind of defeat the purpose, apt.
@carolinemarcus  @nswpolice  this was live on TV so they didn't have time to blur faces. Keep in mind it's LIVE, no time for editing.
@AlBearfaced  @carolinemarcus  @nswpolice  seconded
@AlBearfaced  @carolinemarcus  @AbsntFriends  @nswpolice  some people have no heart taking selfies when around the area
@carolinemarcus  @JewelNature  @nswpolice  So relieved some have escaped/been released.  The experience will haunt them though. Brave police.
@carolinemarcus  @nswpolice  all I want to do is give her a hug. Poor girl. Does bring tears to the eye
@carolinemarcus  @TheTodayShow  @nswpolice  So horrendously terrifying.
“ @carolinemarcus : A shot that captures the #sydneysiege: sheer terror/relief of escaped hostages ” so distressing
@carolinemarcus  @nswpolice  my heart breaks looking at this photo, prayers for all those involved in this horrific ordeal
@carolinemarcus  @AamilneTetsuya  @nswpolice  great photo! Happy she is safe.

@jr1953jr  @ABC7  It's common police practice to do things like this especially if they need for them to corporate.
@adlibsinmyhead  @abc7  lmao 2 for $5
@ABC7  this is disgusting
@ABC7  feed him rat shit
@ABC7  Don't they always do this? It's to get him to cooperate and confess.
@ABC7  nobody gives a fuck that a deranged, racist, serial killer engaging in a hate crime got fake meat from Burger King, REPORT REAL NEWS!
@ABC7  He's in their custody.  Would you rather they starve him and make the news that way??
@ABC7  you can't starve people that in-custody!!
@ABC7  should of starved his dumbass
@ABC7  are you fucking kidding me?
@FAIRx818x  @ABC7  he hadn't eaten in days.  I guess he had it his way lol
@adlibsinmyhead  ABC news is tripping for that one
@ABC7  disgusted. I'm disgusted.
@ABC7  should have let him die of hunger
@ABC7  Idiots, that's what tax dollars do?
. @ABC7  @TheGOPJesus  Dylann Roof is a Hoax and saying this also happened is being done to trigger you into more distraction
@ABC7  Why is this news? If they didn't, defense would claim they withheld food. When they do, it's 'softening' him or coddling him.
Itâ€™s a comparison. An armed mass murderer is arrested and fed. An unarmed man with a fake $20 bill is executed in the street. They looked different...

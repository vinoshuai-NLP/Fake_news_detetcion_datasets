@nytimes  Again, this is a blatant ecological fallacy - hire a statistician!
@nytimes  he won the popular Latino vote. Winning the precincts and its delegates are different. HE WON POPULAR LATINO VOTE, her the precinct
@nytimes  Bernie isn't trying to win the hispanic voter, the Black vote he isn't trying to group pander he is after the American peoples vote
@nytimes  Why would they support someome who wants children deported back to violence torn nations?
@nytimes  @dee_ambrosini  NYT seems biased agst Sanders: Hillary's Hispanic counties are more hispanic then Bernie's. It dsn't prove a thing!
@nytimes   Bernie voters are sore losers.  no dessert for you tonight
@nytimes  Don't worry about Bernie winning anything, he's too busy trying to prove he likes Hillary. Ask Bob Dole how that works out.
@nytimes  Wow! How come the Times corrects statements said by Sanders, but never what Hillary says and she lies all the time?
@nytimes  we should have a reputable economist moderate both debates.

@nytimes  So the entrance-exit polls are correct for Hillary but incorrect for sanders...... ok.
@bigkrpo3  @nytimes  no they were wrong all the way around and I also didn't like the way it was called read again
@nytimes  What it does not prove is that Hillary won it. Why these contorted pro-Hillary headlines?
@roundthebendtv  @nytimes  this only includes primaries which means it's only for NH. Doesn't mean much

@nytimes  it be nice if the times was as thorough with Clinton as they are sanders.
@nytimes  If #HillaryClinton wins the Democratic nomination, our next president will be a Republican! http://salon.com/2016/02/19/hillary_clinton_just_cant_win_democrats_need_to_accept_that_only_bernie_sanders_can_defeat_the_gop/…  #Election2016

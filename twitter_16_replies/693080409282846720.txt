@CNN  @POTUS  someone should let him know about the equal pay act of 1963.
@CNN  @POTUS  There already is equal pay for equal work. This is just more divisive nonsense from the Left.
@CNN  @POTUS  JUST DO IT ALREADY!!!! Women deserve equal pay if not more bc we have the babies too!!!!
@CNN  @POTUS  much needed female graphic designer makes $27000 male $40000 same skill set same hire date
@M_EvansOKC  @CNN  @POTUS  so equal pay for women makes you angry?
@CNN  @POTUS  what  @BarackObama  needs to do to best give women equal opportunity is endorse  @BernieSanders  !
@CNN  @POTUS  A non event. Wag the dog. Hiding from an economy that only grew .7% in the latest qtr
@CNN  can't people just earn pay based on performance any more not political agendas?
@CNN  @POTUS  Have never heard a #GOP candidate mention this issue. What's that all about? They're stuck on fear! Greatest military in history

@CNN  @POTUS   Impeach Obama!
@CNN  @POTUS  Obama should be impeached black or not. You were president because you're black so you should be impeached because you are wrong
@CNN  @POTUS   Very good news.

@WalshFreedom  @USATODAY  LOL. They asked for. Why didn't they just focus on the damn business?
@WalshFreedom  Ours is near a college campus, centered in a well to do liberal neighborhood. They love this stuff. Doubt they'll boycott.  .
@WalshFreedom  @WeNeedMrTrump when did become a issue? Live in FL & have heard any problems. Certainly not a federal government issue.
@WalshFreedom  @USATODAY  Target! Put your $ where your mouth is. Build gender neutral toilets in your stores. Men/girls don't pee together.
@WalshFreedom  @USATODAY  yeah it's not ok. But trans women are women.
@WalshFreedom  @USATODAY  Now me, (as a transman) have to pee next to little girls. Thanks >:(
@WalshFreedom  @USATODAY  The libs will rescue Target, claiming to be more threatened by CCW patriots than they are by perverts in dresses.
@WalshFreedom  @USATODAY  Boycott Target !!
@Samstwitch  @WalshFreedom  It is all about the equipment!
@WalshFreedom  @STSTWO  they could easily have a gender neutral bathroom &spare women, but they want to force acceptance on everyone.
@WalshFreedom  @debra0827  @USATODAY  I hear every pervert in the Country is headed to Target to ---- pee.  Yeah right!.
@WalshFreedom  Target has been hiring alot of gay & lesbian workers i've noticed, they're making alot of shoppers uncomfortable!
@inmatemd  @WalshFreedom  https://afa.net/action-alerts/sign-the-boycott-target-pledge/â€¦
@WalshFreedom  @DonaldTrumpLA  @USATODAY  I will never go to Target again. This policy is insanity!
@WalshFreedom  @USATODAY  protect the rights of women and girls-restrooms need un compromised borders as much as civilizations
@WalshFreedom  @DonaldTrumpLA  #America #BoycottTarget
@WalshFreedom  @ The Target boycott is on!
@WalshFreedom  @USATODAY  it's not bigotry or hate to disagree with targets new policy. http://Make.family restrooms available.
Try selling their stock and contacting invested relations.  It's much more effective. @WalshFreedom  @USATODAY
@WalshFreedom  Boycott Barnes&Noble and Starbucks too. They have the same policy as Target.
@WalshFreedom  @USATODAY  so a man gets to make a women feel uncomfortable so he does not feel uncomfortable in mens room? #BoycottTarget

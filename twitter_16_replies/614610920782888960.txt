@petesouza  @davidgregory  a total disgrace to an American icon.
@rpatricknolan  @petesouza  @davidgregory  an American icon re-earning its stature.
@petesouza  @davidgregory  Loving this week and our SCOTUS decisions!!!!
@petesouza  @davidgregory  um no not what the White House is for, leave it alone
@petesouza  @nprnews  Great pic of the White House.
“ @petesouza : White House w rainbow colors tonight by Chuck Kennedy. ”  @joshgroban  #LoveWins
@petesouza  @nprnews  I pray for mercy on america when we as people begin celebrating sin. Same sex marriage is wrong.
@petesouza  @nprnews  love it!
Just my preference.  @SarahBurris
See the one David Abel tweeted 11 minutes ago.  @SarahBurris
Yes RT  @petesouza  Will be cool photos of the White House w rainbow colors but hard to top this one by Chuck Kennedy
@petesouza  Love it!
@petesouza  @ChazDragoon The Empire State Building is the one I like.
@petesouza  @nprnews   MARRIAGE IS A PASSÉ/RIDICULOUS INSTITUTION
@petesouza  @davidgregory  live this photo if the WhiteHouse !

Appropriately phallic background “ @petesouza : There will be cool photos of the White House w rainbow colors tonight. ”
@quominus  @petesouza  @vj44  The White House is not a billboard,
@petesouza  better be having that colors because people are able to love who they love
@petesouza  @MiddleAmericaMS  That's great!   @Psaki44  's picture was close, though.

@petesouza  @nprnews  great news...super picture.
@the_craigen  @quominus  @petesouza  @vj44  wow, what a witty and eloquent response
@the_craigen  @quominus  @petesouza  @vj44  who helped you spell the big words shortbus?
@the_craigen  @quominus  @petesouza  @vj44  they're both dead...swing and a miss, strike two
@petesouza  ....The "night-watchman" in DC could have used better judgement this evening?
@petesouza  @emilybazelon  Nice Erection
@the_craigen  I figured you for a necro kind of guy
@petesouza  @emilybazelon  "God gave Noah the rainbow sign, no more water the fire next time."
@petesouza  Sodom and Gomorrah would be so proud
@petesouza  @davidgregory

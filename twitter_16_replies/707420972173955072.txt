@nypost  such bullshit. Isn't he the president of all people?  First Scalia now Nancy.
@nypost  this tiresome piece crap never fails to take the low road.
@nypost  Idiot
@nypost  @POTUS  #worstpresidentever
@nypost  what's new? He's a douche.
@bwa_aptos  @Quibbie_ Just remember, many of the 20 year old kids who voted for him in '08 are approaching 30 and bitching about unemployment
@nypost  @sn_hammond more important of course
@nypost  not sure why he would be expected there
@nypost  #BostonHerald #nypost http://theblaze.com/news/saudi-nationalâ€¦ http://theblaze.com/fortherecord
@nypost  I KNEW IT!!!! He never disappoints. Can he walk on sacred ground? Cross threshold of a church? What a slap in the face, shame!
@nypost  that's cold man
@nypost  if it wasn't this excuse there'd be another. Something- anything to keep him from paying his respects to this lady/family. Shame.
@nypost  the term is priority of work as dual hatted
@nypost  That's our President always there !
@nypost   He doesn't want to miss the concert
@nypost  u think with his two experience before being president he would know that attending is a priority.   Unreal
@nypost
@nypost  As is presidential tradition. Drop it.

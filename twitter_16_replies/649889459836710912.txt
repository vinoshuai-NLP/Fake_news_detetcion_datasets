@nytimes  Tactician.
@nytimes   If the WH were spinning this damage control they would've said Kim Davis was needing counsel about entering into her 5th marriage.
@nytimes  yea, right.
@nytimes  @TheTattooedProf  apparently once you're sufficiently holy it's totes OK to be wildly dishonest
@nytimes  ok to endorse religious beliefs; not ok to wield beliefs to support punishment of non believers!
@nytimes  thank you - Holy Father should not support those who punish non believers!
@nytimes  who cares iam sick if this Kim Davis woman getting attention ... yes I respect her belief but move on
@nytimes  lol
. @nytimes  To be clear, Pope Francis did not have spiritual relations with that woman.
@nytimes  @DeanLeh  lol....he didn't even know she was there.
@DeanLeh  @nytimes  The news I saw said she was with group of dozens invited by lower echelon to see Pope off to NYC. No appointments 4 anyone
@DeanLeh  @nytimes  But.....had he seen her, that would be his call not ours The same as it was Jesus' call to see t whores and tax collectors
@nytimes  that's hilarious
@nytimes  Kim Davis appears to have exploited people her entire life.She apparently thrives off of hurting people, even  @Pontifex
@nytimes  @Clarknt67  then why did he make similar statements?
@nytimes  your idea of what is important and is breaking news is really off. Not trending.
@nytimes  I have doubt with this Pope .. I don't know, very confusing Pope ever !

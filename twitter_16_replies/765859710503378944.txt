@BBCNews  @longisland  well north Korea leader is crazy
Just like the birds, heading south for the winter... I would do so too if I could. #WillMissSummer
@BBCNews   Probably just fancied a Korea change
@BBCNews  I think that the leader of north Korea is crazy
@BBCNews   He can be a spy.. if he wanted freedom he could go everyhell in the world, but he goes to south Korea!
@BBCNews  you mean the house in Gunnersbury 
Anyone who gets trapped in that hermit nation would really think of fleeing if given the opportunity.
Is he safe that close, in S. Korea?
Yes, we do!
I'm pretty sure I'm not the first one to tell you that
very brave.
he won't anymore if he did
#Prayers4Safety #PurePurpose   @BBCBreaking  @BBCNews
@denajag  @BBCNews  lucky to make it out of that hell hole.

@ABC  we have a well greased terror into the wilderness in play. Thank you O and lapdog media
@ABC  we all should be able to carry guns so if it's going to go down. At least you can defend yourself. Not wait on cops.
. @ABC  We do have a pattern of mass murders perpetrated by illegals since Obasturd took office. The blood of 10,000+ citizens is on his hands
. @ABC  @POTUS  how many Chicago, Baltimore, Ferguson, Detroit's do you need before you start acting like a President and not a protester?
@ABC  @POTUS  if you still have to wrap your head around the last shooting and already have a new one to process, it's more than a pattern
@ABC  @KRDONC13  thank you Mr President, you've succeeded
@RyanBLeslie  Nearly 2800 shootings in Chicago this year.  @ABC
@ABC  Thank you #captainobvious. Putting your #harvardlaw degree to good use I see.   @BarackObama
@ABC  Shooting was in a gun free zone located in a state with the strictest gun control laws &  @POTUS  wants gun control? SMH
@ABC  Obama No evidence of attacks during holiday http://usat.ly/1jjE00m      http://tripeilat.com/the-emperors-new-clothes-obama/…
@ABC  We have a pattern now of politicians & a president that uses tragedy as a public relations advocacy for gun control. SHAME SHAME
@ABC  this guy. Just go away!
@ABC  what is the cause? and how can we fix it? real answers here - http://painefultruth76.blogspot.com/2015/09/guns-and-root-of-americas-problem-with.html…
@RyanBLeslie  I'm sure the people of Kenya, Tunisia, Nigeria, and Norway might disagree.  @ABC
@RyanBLeslie  that's not on his agenda, none of those vote
@ABC  It is a PATTERN n its becoming the NORM so do something about it DOMESTIC Terrorism is WORST than foreign because they are already HERE
@ABC  I think Obama needs to show up in Chicago and check random people in south side . I think he might find a gun or two.
@ABC  Stop de Guns..!!... no more victims!!
@ABC   Soon he will announce a special TRACK,  Czar, to head up: -Total -Response -Access with -Collaborative -Knowledge  ...just suggesting
@ABC  on his watch...
@ABC  and we have had gun free zones since George Bush signed it into law.  Laws don't stop evil actors bent on killing people.
@RyanBLeslie  @ABC  I didn't hear about this at all.
@RyanBLeslie  @ABC  I consider myself to be news worthy, can't believe no headlines came my way.
@RyanBLeslie  @ABc  no deaths, no national broadcast I guess.
@ABC  sure do.  In GUN FREE ZONES
@ABC  where was Obama when cops were being killed.  Bet he tries to downplay this if it is terrorist
@ABC  CORRECT MR.PRESIDENT BUT THERE R MANY THAT JUST REFUSE TO TAKE ACTION BY LISTENING AND WE KNOW WHO THEY ARE
@RyanBLeslie  @ABC  YOUR ONE OF THE PEOPLE HE'S TALKING TO LESLIE RYAN
@ABC  #ForgiveMeForAsking but can our #POTUS show genuine emotion without hiding behind a political agenda?
@GuitarLawInk well, those are terror related. So it's a different motive.
@ABC  we need a pattern of people defending themselves how about reintroducing fire arms classes in schools
@ABC  where has he been hiding? What a joke!
@GuitarLawInk they aren't being discounted by any means. Our numbers are way above when it comes to amount of incidents.
@GuitarLawInk we are talking about frequency here.. remember that, look at this chart from just a month ago. http://wsj.com/articles/u-s-leads-world-in-mass-shootings-1443905359…
Attacks such as #SanBernardino just as prone  @ABC  via balance of probability on gun proliferation as via the terror charged message of ISIL.

@CNN  yea a mars sized planet crashed into earth and all of the debris created the moon. That's why moon material=same as earth material
@CNN  how much pot do you have must be some good scientific pot reminds me of string theory - did you watch cartoons as child!!!
@CNN  and then again maybe GOD created it.
@CNN  lucky for us or the Lunatics would have been called Earthlings
@CNN  What if #Earth was created as a result of the Moon crashing into another planet? Which planet? Probably what is now the asteroid belt.
@CNN  and the asteroid belt if stitchin book remember correctly... Nobody has the draft copy..
@CNN  thank God. No Moon, no Life.
@CNN  Just a thought: If the moon is a result of an accident, why is it's surface made up of Glassy Rocks? Perfect for reflecting the Sun?
@CNN  .iii
@CNN  prove it
@CNN  I think they're looking at each others photos of Uranus too much
@CNN  There will be another  near planet collision in the future...the waves will be roaring
@CNN  just a collision? a "short bang" could be the right theory. Why not, or a "scrambled egg". Suggesting that it has ever been like that
@CNN  nobody will ever no for sure so just stop talking about the creation of the universe
@CNN  collisions formed our solar system, our galaxy, our universe... so yeah.
@CNN  Seems the solar system was a very crowded place early in it's history (when Uranus got knocked on its side too).
@CNN  ok what ever happen it will still be beautiful
@CNN  LOL-very funny CNN- hahahahahaha
. @CNN  what a perfect collision? NOT!  Moon in perfect orbit for earth's tides etc? Wake up, it was created specifically for this purpose!
@CNN  May have? My research says the sun was once an icy planet!
@CNN  Cant believe your only getting around to this now, this was news 15 years ago, well done.
@CNN  no it did
@CNN  Moon is round, Earth is round,  Now your heads are oblong and #EmptyBowls
@CNN  Yeah I thought we discovered this already
@CNN  so cool
@CNN  read Genesis there's your answer to the moon
@CNN  Wow, you mean somebody else has read Sitchin's The Twelfth Planet? These science revelations are getting more and more lame. Not New.
@CNN  This theory has been around for a while.
@CNN  I thought this was already established?...
@CNN  no ways

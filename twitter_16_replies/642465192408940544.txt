@Lrihendry  Not my son, but I'm waiting
@DubinPeter  @ChrisCoon4  @Lrihendry  Maybe Trump could deport the 4 million Ragheads along with the 11 million illegals! :)
@Lrihendry  @ChrisCoon4  When are parents in this country going to get a backbone and put a stop to this nonsense?
@Lrihendry  @mriecs yet they are banning everything Christian in this country
@Lrihendry  Hey athiests did you MISS THIS?
@Lrihendry  @AmericanAtheist  Hey YOU MISSED THIS athiests. What ya gonna do? Promote it or nothing?
@Lrihendry  Make some noise, AMERICA  In GOD We Trust & we are a Christian nation!
@Eccentrie  @Lrihendry  i think you were a Christian nation....(non offending)
@Lrihendry  @Eccentrie  this crap must stop WE are legitimizing a Government in its own. Arabs have big $ invested in publishing co. Ask why?
@ranchdancer  It's obvious. Some History books have already been re-written with Islam as part of America's founding
@Lrihendry  @AsiaKorycinska  unbelievable, is it true? How praising any god might be forced especially into children?
@Lrihendry  @mskimrose Where is the uproar about separation of church and state?
@Lrihendry  @mskimrose Did parents even know until after the fact?
@mskimrose  @Lrihendry  I would hope not.

@Kotcha301  @BarbMuenchen  @Lrihendry  This cannot be true
@Lrihendry  @Pudingtane  this can't be true
@Lrihendry  @Pudingtane  really
@mskimrose  @Lrihendry  Probably why so many parents are homeschooling when possible.
@Lrihendry  @MileHiLady52 liberal progressives only demand #SeparationOfChurchAndState  if it involves Christianity or Christmas decorations

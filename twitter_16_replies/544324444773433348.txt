@mashable  vile profiteering, time to end  @uber_sydney , if not  @Uber  globally

@mashable  it's called gouging and it's disgraceful.
@mashable  @nycjim  They always say that.
.  @mashable  This is such a strange approach to providing help. #sydneysiege
@danalcraig  @mashable  @Uber_Sydney  they're free now after the twitter outrage

@Pasik1982  @mashable  they've since made rides free. #badprmovebro
@mashable  That's repulsive. I believe  @Uber  15 minutes will be up soon. Bad management, poor decision making. #TakeaCab
.  @mashable  @Uber  is valued at 48 billion. If it really cared about more cars to help the #SydneySiege why not pay difference themselves?

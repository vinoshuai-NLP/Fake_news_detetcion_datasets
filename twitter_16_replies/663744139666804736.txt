@mydaughtersarmy  @emilydawnlove  some people have more time then sense,
@mydaughtersarmy  @Bipartisanism  so you give a homeless person some $ € £ ¥ .... You do that everyday? Volunteer soup kitchens, food pantrys
@mydaughtersarmy  @Bipartisanism  just wait,just wait ;week of Christmas walking into a starfucks wearing reindeer antlers and farting loudly
@mydaughtersarmy  @Bipartisanism  Thank You 4 such good tweets!Much Appreciation!
@mydaughtersarmy  @CassandraRules  oh no!!! No more snowflakes
@mydaughtersarmy  I think they look great #RedCups all Christmas long hahah
@mydaughtersarmy  @PFTrudel Well said. Too bad we can be so caught up in being PC, we forget to be kind.
@mydaughtersarmy  @LisaHunter14  well said !
@mydaughtersarmy  Best Tweet ever!
@mydaughtersarmy  @soucydm  why doesn't the homeless guy go into Starbucks for a job?
@mydaughtersarmy  @alancoxshow  We all know he would just buy more Starbucks coffee if we gave him money
@mydaughtersarmy  agreed.I have called everyone for help.goodwill.etc they pass the buck and tell you 2call elsewhere https://m.gofund.me/3v8ynbn3
@mydaughtersarmy  @cody_knerr bc im sure if I give him $ he'll put it toward the jacket he's diligently saving up for and not a crack rock
@mydaughtersarmy  you, my friend, are too listed at DailyKos!!!
@mydaughtersarmy  Damn auto-correct...meant to say top listed.
@mydaughtersarmy  Amen! Where is the outrage for homelessness?
@mydaughtersarmy  @IBtalking  Homelessness, war, & all mayhem & misery r natural result of this immoral,unjust capitalism. Down w/capitalism
@mydaughtersarmy  @DrReneeObey And don't forget to tell him to "GET A JOB!" on your way out!
@DFWSuperAgent  @mydaughtersarmy  @AtheistWorld  actually there is scientific evidence against this.
@mydaughtersarmy  @dcowger  wish I could retweet this 50 times!
@mydaughtersarmy  @rose_evers Is that a non sequitur?
@mydaughtersarmy     A higher percentage of christians donate to the homeless then non-religious in north america.   How about you?
@mydaughtersarmy
@serrebi  @mydaughtersarmy  he's trying to decide if he wants coffee or crack.
@beatle_buff  @mydaughtersarmy  Maybe but it's a more important thing we ignore for dumb shits to complain about god not being on a cup.
@serrebi  @mydaughtersarmy  if he's wanting coffee over being homeless he's messed up.
@beatle_buff  @mydaughtersarmy  Yes, I agree with you there.
@Blindbeader  @mydaughtersarmy  Still have not met or spoken to a single Christian offended by those cups. Do they actually exist?
@SisterDawn  ware people can find offence they will for the most part
. @DFWSuperAgent  Are you saying that atheists can't be good??? Wow. #arrogant #judgemental  @mydaughtersarmy
@dfwsuperagent  @iampacer  Ever hear "No atheists in foxholes?" I know the intended meaning, but 2 me? It sez mostly 'believers' kill en masse
@dfwsuperagent  @iampacer  Let's remember: When atheists do right, it's not out of hope 4 heavenly reward or fear of posthumous punishment :-)
@mydaughtersarmy  @CopelandColette  TRUE  SMH
@mydaughtersarmy  @co_kmaldonado4  it's against the law to feed homeless ppl or for them to eat in public in houston, land of ted the rwc
@mydaughtersarmy  @Getsmart4  Nothing sez "Happy Stolen Pagan Holiday Make-Believe Birthday Jesus" better than a $5 cup of flavored brown H2O!

. @BernieSanders  . @WCVI  voodoo mathematics just like his economic proposals that don't add up.
. @BernieSanders  @WCVI  News outlets reported this as so,all day long, so when did this"fact"change?Also,I see wildly varied delegate counts-?
@BernieSanders  @WCVI  OK, OK,  He'll get his damn Ribbon.
If Bernie Sanders walked on water, news next day would read, "Bernie Sanders can't swim." @BernieSanders  @WCVI  @meetthepress  @FaceTheNation
@WCVI  My Video is Over 14,000 Views  @BernieSanders  #TimeHasComeToday #FeelTheBern #SCPrimary #SuperTuesday #Bernie
Ties but for a coin toss Iowa, trounces Clinton 20? pts N Hampshire, loses by 5 in NV... @BernieSanders  @WCVI  @meetthepress  @FaceTheNation
...and the media declares Hilary the big winner? If the numbers had been reversed, would you have said same of Bernie? @BernieSanders  @WCVI
@BernieSanders  @WCVI  ... No. That is a lie. Los latinos conocemos los resultados de las polÃ­ticas socialistas que Sanders propone.
@BernieSanders  @WCVI  Hey, how about Loretta Sanchez for VP pick?
@BernieSanders  @WCVI  Viva #PoliticalRevolution #NotMeUs
@BernieSanders  @WCVI  Sir, U WON = GOOD, "ENGLISH ONLY" = OUTDATED => DO NOT LIVE IN PAST, NOW IS NOW. WORLD MOVES FAST=> BE ADAPTIVE
@BernieSanders  @WCVI   you lost say it real slow..
@BernieSanders  @WCVI  uh. look at math.  .77*.13+.47*.59+.45*.19=46.3% from 91% of votes.  H won 52.6%. She won 2/3 of other 9% of voters?
@BernieSanders  @WCVI  huge if true.  (It's not.)
@BernieSanders  @WCVI  this is a complete lie. You are deliberately lying to your naive base. Shame on you, Bernie. #Fraud
@BernieSanders  @WCVI  this latino isn't voting for you.  Hillary is our best bet.
@BernieSanders  @WCVI  not surprised!  the Clinten corruption machine is spinning....
@BernieSanders  @Latinos4Bernie  @WCVI  won't see that on CNN
@BernieSanders  @Wally_Callahan  @WCVI  Bernaics meme when Hillary wins it is fraud GOP crossing over&voting Sanders to knock out Hillary is OK
@BernieSanders  @Brains4Bern  @WCVI  Bogus. Catch up. Actual counts say Clinton won the NV Latino vote!
@BernieSanders  @WCVI  Yea really, give it a rest will you.
@BernieSanders  @WCVI  Its funny because they work the hardest.Uh oh...I just played into a stereotype,right? Nope, life experience.
@BernieSanders  @WCVI   Clinton's edge over Sanders is largely based on Black voters. HC lost the Latino vote (45%) to Sanders (53%).
@BernieSanders  @SpaceCheef  @WCVI  And you are dreaming.
@BernieSanders  @GOP_The4thReich  @WCVI  - Voting for #Bernie2016 is giving  votes to the #GOP. He is like an empty vessel.
. @BernieSanders  @WCVI  more bullshit. We know he voted against immigration reform, supported the minute men and  H.R. 4437 Sensenbrenner bill
@ams121372 Hillary supported deporting children back to Central America to send a "message." If she'll deport CHILDREN who is next?

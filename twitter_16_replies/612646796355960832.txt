@ajplus  @YourAnonNews  @theobserver  not true
@ajplus  @YourAnonNews  @theobserver  height - 0ft 0 inches????
@ajplus  @YourAnonNews  @theobserver   This is terrible 
@ajplus  @YourAnonNews  @theobserver  Was it a #PieceOfBurger ?
@ajplus  @YourAnonNews  @theobserver  that's actually one of the worst forms of torture I have ever heard of
@MrBananaManYeee  @MADWAVY  @ajplus  @theobserver  are you fucking retarded...
@MADWAVY  @MrBananaManYeee  @ajplus  @theobserver  we obviously have an idiotic ignorant racist on our hands.
@ajplus  @theobserver  nobody gives a fuck about what that terrorist eats, you wanna rub his privilege on our faces so bad its disgusting.
@YourAnonNews  @ajplus  If anyone ever deserved a police beat down its this asshole, not a meal from Burger King. #CharlestonShooting
@ajplus  @YourAnonNews  @theobserver  They were hoping to give him food poisoning and save the trial costs.
@ajplus  @theobserver  A lot of times with this type of suspect, you get them food, try to get them trusting you, and they talk real easy.
@MADWAVY  @MrBananaManYeee  @ajplus  @theobserver  oh another one did. look at my last tweets lmaoooo
@ajplus  @YourAnonNews  @theobserver  Can all prisoners get the same treatment please? Thx Uncle Sam #JusSaying
@ajplus  @theobserver  Burger King instead of a "rough ride"?
@MADWAVY  @San4anpsycho  and had a bullet proof jacket. lol special treatment always for the white folks. but when an unarmed black man
@YGBAYLEE  @MADWAVY  @San4anpsycho  Not siding but a suspect is at risk, they're given a bullet-proof vest. Ex: Lee Boyd Malvo.
@MADWAVY  @San4anpsycho  screams stop bc cops have him in a chock hold for no reason, he ends up dead bc of ignorant, racist police officers
@ajplus  @Reem_Abdellatif  @theobserver  A7A
@MrBananaManYeee @YGBAYLEE  @MADWAVY  @ajplus  @theobserver  he would be processed then have to wait for jail food.
@ajplus  this cannot be true
@ajplus  @theobserver  Erm..
@ajplus  @theobserver  death plenty  that what he deserves
@ajplus  @ChienJenn  @theobserver  That is an Interrogation tactic, used to build a rapport with the subject, to make confession more likely.
@TOMREEDNJ  @ajplus  @theobserver  Do you think Tsarnaev got some chicken fries?
@ajplus  Delete this bullshit...
@MADWAVY  @YGBAYLEE  @San4anpsycho  I didn't say he should, I said that's usually what happens with a popular suspect. Don't let your emotions
@MADWAVY  @YGBAYLEE  @San4anpsycho  Cloud your logic man. That's when nothing gets accomplished
@ajplus  @YourAnonNews  @theobserver  so they are choosing the slow torture method
@ajplus  @theobserver  wtf
@MADWAVY  @YGBAYLEE  @ajplus  @theobserver  looks like a bullet proof vest to me ok 
@SegaRoc  @MADWAVY  @ajplus  @theobserver  shall I gather up all the whites who have had the bullet proof privilege? vs blacks?
@ajplus  @8e99a
@ajplus  I absolutely HATE straight, mid 40s, white people BYE!
@ajplus  @theobserver  I'll kill this nigga
@ajplus  smfh

@Rollinthunder02  @YahooNews  Their money. Their choice. 1 needy life is not more important than another. You should be praising them
@YahooNews  @jaypelll
@YahooNews  "his wife"? Come on  @AFP  you should know better
@YahooNews  Very nice news.  Better when headline writer treats female spouse as human being.
@UltraVerified  @TwoOneSix216  @YahooNews  Haha. They truly  deserve one another. Gross out.
@YahooNews  if you had gone with "mah wiiife" it would've been acceptable
@YahooNews  in 2015-16 women still being written out of history good job  @yahoonews
@YahooNews  do your research please! Isla Fisher is an amazing actress & person. And she is more than "his wife ".
@YahooNews  What the hell year is this again? #hiswife
@YahooNews  stop being sexist. Isla Fisher donated as much money as he (Sasha B. Cohen) did. Also, she is a successful actress.
@YahooNews  She has a name. She's kinda famous. Lazy stupid Yahoo.
@YahooNews  P.S. I'm much more likely to watch Isla in "Wedding Crashers" than any of Borat's tired "comedies" any day.
@YahooNews  @_FoxyCleopatra Lets face it, HE donated the money, she is an evil parasitic woman who brags about manipulating men.
@YahooNews  she has a name
@YahooNews  1. It's Sacha Baron Cohen. 2. Isla Fisher is an accomplished and famous actress. Man, surprised by what passes for journalism
@YahooNews  Sacha Baron Cohen & Isla Fisher compassionate and generous
@YahooNews  @thealien_earth  She doesn't have a name ? #auspol
@cyijker22 saw the link posted elsewhere.
@YahooNews  where is the money going? Where? how? Is there a tax break in there for them?
@T_to_B  @YahooNews  @AFP  Do not bonk me: https://pic.twitter.com/CQi54sYjcR
@YahooNews   They just had to make sure the whole world knew about it.If it is even true.
@YahooNews  
@YahooNews  @AFP  she's called Isla Fisher
@YahooNews  Isla Fisher??

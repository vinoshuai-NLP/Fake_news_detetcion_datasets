@reuters  the #Humanum & the upcoming #OctoberSynod will provide more clarity, remember the Left Liberal FLIP agenda is at hand, we R @ APEX
@Reuters  Major misstep by the Pope and Vatican. She is promoting defiance and the Pope agreed?
@Reuters  hey, like, I don't wanna be all seventh day Adventist or anything but... not a big fan of these guys...
@Reuters  @freakingcat   Bigot supporting bigot. What's not to understand? {pukes}
@theophontes  @Reuters  The amazing thing is that the Pope is gay himself. He has since over 20 years a partner who is with him in the Vatican
@Reuters  Does the Pope consider gay marriage illegal? ?? Tell me please.
@Reuters  @Pontifex  It's good to make the distinction. While standing for your values is good, not when it forces oppression on others.
It's pretty #chickenshit of the Pope but he can excommunicate the Mafia but he tiptoes around Sodomites. Pretty pathetic POS  @Reuters
and why did liberty counsel say anything anyway? Christians don't recognize the Popes authority anyway. They should stayed silent.  @Reuters
They don't call him the #falseprophet for nothing. Christians don't recognize the Popes authority anyway. So Who Gives a Shit  @Reuters
@Reuters  Religious people problems. MEH
@Reuters  I thought gay marriage was sort of against catholic beliefs. So should the Vatican be unbiased?
@Reuters  @HumanistFury  I would check sources on this one
@Reuters  @DeityFree  Meh. Who gives an at's rass what an "official" says --let alone Bergoglio? Birds of a feather frock together.
@HumanistFury  @Reuters  I understand that but does it make sense? Really? Wondering original source & purpose
@Reuters
@Reuters  The infallible are fallible? Good to know
@Reuters  Well Duh true colors were shown .
@ArizonaLuke  @PattyJahner  @cnalive  #perpetualweepersofpersecution #shitmoronssay
@Reuters  Infallible? I think not.
@Reuters  Simple damage control... the Vatican wants it both ways; that group is not my moral compass, doesn't deserve the attention it gets
@Reuters  if but an1 wuld stnd agst gay law it shld b d church of christ.if d vatica fail 2 se it sf as d church of christ wat den christiaty
@HumanistFury  @Reuters  ok
@Reuters  How can you have a sense of regret over meeting a human being? What kind of religious people are you? Politicians or Priests? Smh
@Reuters  lol more manipulated shite - uttered from that disgusting cult.
@Reuters  For a pope to single out one persons gain in financial & fictitious belief is a malicious act & without merit.
@Reuters  meeting her could have been balanced by his views if it were not kept as a secret,  Secrecy was the mistake.
@Reuters  only after the fuss. Why would they think meeting her was a good idea in the first place.
@Reuters  I'll bet there is. That idiot woman deserves no credence.
@ArizonaLuke  @PattyJahner  @cnalive  #perpetualweepersofpersecution #shitmoronssay I'm atheist please try again
@Reuters  Nothing, and I mean Nothing or No one can do mystery and intrigue like the Church.

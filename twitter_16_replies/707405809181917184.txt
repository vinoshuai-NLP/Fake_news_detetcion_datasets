@thehill  AMEN
@thehill  Oh for heavens sakes
@thehill  bad enough that Bachmann does nonsense tweets, but The Hill covering them is the real nonsense.
@thehill  isn't she still "praying the gay away" for her um husband?
@thehill  Might miss his golf game!
@thehill  Leave it to Bachmann to use Nancy Reagan's funeral as an excuse to knock President Obama. Bachmann is definitely the classless one.
@thehill   PBO has more integrity in his little finger than the entire GOP. King Trump is a classless loud-mouthed vulgar bully not for Pres!
@thehill  President did not attend Lady Bird Johnson's funeral also, didn't hear anybody complaining about that
@thehill   nothing we haven't known for 7 years. She wasn't Muslim or a member of BLM or any other of his favorite groups.
@thehill   Obama is a thug.....classless would be a step up for him
@thehill   So GOP. Can't even bury the lady, whom I'm sure would graciously, more than understand, without being petty about it. Oh Michelle.
@thehill  Maybe Obama spent too much time watching HoC, lately...
@thehill   If he had attended hers & Scalia's funeral, Obama-bashers would criticize cuz of attention/distraction created! Shame on you all!
@thehill  true colors once again
@thehill  @Lg4Lg  @MicheleBachmann  But seriously, would you want him there?
@OmegaMan58  @thehill  @Lg4Lg  @MicheleBachmann  U make a valid point. Hussein-O attending Mrs.Reagan's funeral is like a vampire attending Mass
@thehill  @OmegaMan58  This is not news. It simply correctly characterizes him.
@thehill  @Lg4Lg  Did anyone really think he would go? Must have a T time!

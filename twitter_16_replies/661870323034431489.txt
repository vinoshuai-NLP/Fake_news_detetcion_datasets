@Mullane45  @individualchic  anyone who didn’t see this coming has rocks in their heads. Nat Geo died in Sept. Corpse kept moving for a month.
@Mullane45  @ChuckWendig  who could see this coming? (Besides me.)
@Mullane45  @ERN_Malleyscrub  @ReverbPress  wish he do that to all his papers, kill them
Can we execute him yet? " @KameronHurley  “ @Mullane45  Holy shit. Rupert Murdoch just killed National Geographic. http://reverbpress.com/business/rupert-murdoch-national-geographic-layoffs/…””

RIP National Geographic MT " @Mullane45 : Rupert Murdoch just killed National Geographic. http://reverbpress.com/business/rupert-murdoch-national-geographic-layoffs/…”
@Mullane45  @FioraAeterna  While sad, this particular article is misleading, if not anoutright lie. Other articles say the layoffs were 9%.
@Mullane45  @FioraAeterna  I don't get it, I thought they sold the magazine and TV and that it's the remaining part that's cutting jobs.
@poploser  ?! Jeez that’s a terrible misrepresentation in the article…
@poploser  he normally doesn’t completely kill it this fast. I give it a year.
@poploser  I hope so and that I’m just being unfairly cynical.
@poploser  thanks for the correction.
@Mullane45  @futureman1962    sad to have to boycott that too. Only temporary I hope
@Mullane45  @MakingStarWars  God damn that is depressing.

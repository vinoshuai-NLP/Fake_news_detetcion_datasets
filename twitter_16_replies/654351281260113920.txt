@tobiascarrier  @Katlaya  @CNN  @BernieSanders  #cnn put the poll back up RT and flood twitter and FB #feelthebern
@dudefindthebox  @tobiascarrier  @CNN  @BernieSanders  Doing my best, but I've had surgery and I'm getting tired.
@tobiascarrier  @mightyones1968  @CNN  @BernieSanders  A joke
@tobiascarrier  @avantghettonyc  @CNN  @BernieSanders  More concerning: 2% of people think Jim Webb won.
@tobiascarrier  @GideonZhi  @CNN  @BernieSanders  For me, Clinton is more plastic than a Barbie doll and I don't believe a word she says.
@tobiascarrier  @DocweedEVE  @CNN  @BernieSanders  didn't Reddit basically bomb all the big polls? Like slate, etc?
@mrhotdogvendor  @tobiascarrier  @CNN  @BernieSanders  hey 4chan voted webb up to like 35% on the time poll why cant reddit?
@tobiascarrier  @ardiem1m  @CNN  @BernieSanders  Thought the Press is supposed to report the news, not try to sway opinion and make it
@Greyseeker  @tobiascarrier  @CNN  @BernieSanders  Establishment owns media, backs HRC. And that really looks bad for her. Gone.

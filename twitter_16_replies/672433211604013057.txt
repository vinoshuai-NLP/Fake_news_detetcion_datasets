@Rockprincess818  Could this be encouragement on his part, to complete  his agenda?
@Rockprincess818  @physicsgeek  wow. That's astounding, and telling.
@Rockprincess818  interesting do you know if the non Obama#'s include gang violence?
@Rockprincess818  it's looks like something is now being counted that wasn't before

@Rockprincess818  - according to  @JohnRLottJr  these stats are false...
@Todd_C_Meyer  @Rockprincess818  @JohnRLottJr  Maybe they aren't totally accurate. But we weren't having these kinds of convos pre-2008z
@Rockprincess818  @tdtrpnr  2 liberal presidents, most shootings.  Control upped under Clintoon also.
@Rockprincess818  @EricJWest  that's what gun control does - disarms law abiding citizens - helpless against murdering swines
@Rockprincess818  DID YOU HEAR THAT OBAMA???LISTEN 2THE PPL WHO PAYS UR PAY CK!!IT'S NOT GUNS SIR,ITS UR DECISION2ALLOW ANY&EVERYONE IN!STOP!
4/4 passage of life & time. I see the uptick in violence as a cleansing of our collective karma @je_suis_liberte  @Rockprincess818
@ChanlElvn  @je_suis_liberte  @Rockprincess818  How does the slaughter of the innocent cleanse "our collective karma?"
@Rockprincess818  @ChristiChat  Where is the source for these stats ?  #interesting
@Rockprincess818  @DonnyLateNight  are gang related shootings of more than 1 person considered mass shootings? Or domestic shootings >1?
@Rockprincess818  @CarmineZozzora  now I understand Obama, it's simple he's not responsible for anything it's global warming, what a concept
@thatbaseballgal  @Rockprincess818  nah it's just because before we didn't have as many idiots running around on the streets
@Rockprincess818  @hautedamn  like Obama said, "Enough is enough", let's impeach him and get the number back to a dozen or so.
@thatbaseballgal  @Rockprincess818  nope, just idiots
@Rockprincess818  according to liberal math there's been 352 this year, so it's even worse if you add murdered feelings. #LiberalLogic
@Rockprincess818  @LIpatriot1  Does anyone else find this very peculiar? #ISmellARat
@Rockprincess818  @AceThug69  So it's Obama's fault people are insane?
@nerd_diggy  @Rockprincess818  @AceThug69  no, it's the insane people's fault for electing him...
@Rockprincess818  Obama drives the narrative
@Rockprincess818  @n00000048  how about the numbers in the workforce breakdown too??
@Rockprincess818  @steph93065  terror will continue to reign as long as good men do nothing. Obama has to be a plant to destroy america
@Rockprincess818  @TheTortorian  Its hard not to give excuses to anyone, but social cohesion must be part of it. Obama divides.
@je_suis_liberte  @ChanlElvn  @Rockprincess818  I suspect the key to understanding this is social cohesion. Obama divides.
@BrotherIvo  @je_suis_liberte  @Rockprincess818 We r a multicultural multilateral nation Cohesion's not necessary/plausible - just Cooperation
@Rockprincess818  @hautedamn  Imma check this...
@Rockprincess818  wow

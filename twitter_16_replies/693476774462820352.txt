@Reuters  Common sense. But good luck trying to get someone to move back to war ravaged lands. The Turk workers have stayed 40 years now.
@Reuters  Maybe they can deport Merkel, too.
@Reuters  Not sure they risk their life to "return home"... They would have stayed in Turkey then...
@Reuters  Yep, like that will ever happen
@Reuters  war will not be over and even if it ends, they will not go back.
@Reuters  it's to late!! The levy has broken..
@Reuters  when the war is over?The refugees of fighting age should be fighting isis! Isis will own Iraq and Syria, all of it now
@Reuters  I think the only way they are going to "stop" isis is if the US makes a "deal" with them now. Not joking!
@JerryArk  she knows she is going to be kicked out soon, because Germans are so mad at her, she has to say this to try to look good now

@Reuters  @RaghuAiyar  Now she is hoping for an impossible event of ending Syria war ,this is going indefinitely as all r playing  politics
@Reuters  The German citizens should storm the statehouse and remove that idiot from power.
@Reuters   
@Reuters  She has lost the plot
@Reuters  this what exactly , I got in mind and I have covered this at d beginning and it's coming
@Reuters  does she mean the war that has gone on since before the Crusades. Good luck with that.

@RollingStone  *MUCH* better... I was trying to figure out what the hell happened to Beck for a bit there...
@RollingStone  @nowhereperson9
@RollingStone  Beck's version of "Win" is one of my favorite cover's of Bowie tunes.
@RollingStone  Which one of your fuckin child interns got the original post wrong?
@RollingStone  @beck   very nice
@RollingStone  @beck  yes. Totally.
@RollingStone  @beck  it shows 
@RollingStone  @MinaCaputo  Beck's version of "Sound and Vision" was amazing.
@Beegirl27  @RollingStone  @MinaCaputo  yeah agreed would love to hear Beck do a take on "Lazarus"
@MinaCaputo  @Beegirl27  @RollingStone  will do like the velvet underground too
@MinaCaputo  @OConnorKeith  @RollingStone  Thanks for the heads up. I'll definitely be checking that out. :)
@MinaCaputo  @OConnorKeith   @RollingStone  Awesome.  I love VU.  John Cale is so experimental.  Love his stuff with La Monte Young.  Drone!!!
@RollingStone  @beck  hi
@RollingStone  @beck  I would rather have had you do the Grammy tribute.
@RollingStone  @beck  Thank you and your dad for creating such a beautiful tribute for Bowie!  Sound and Vision, indeed!!

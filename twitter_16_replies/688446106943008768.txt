@eonline  omg! I feel for the actors that were nominated. Not able to enjoy "their" moment. Feeling like #KanyeAndTaylorSwiftMoment Anyone?
@eonline  @chrisrock  why do we focus on color!! It's all about talent.  Not right..not funny.
@eonline  sheignef
@eonline  not a very happy start 
“ @eonline : Oscars 2016 host Chris Rock calls event "White BET Awards" due to lack of diversity: ” is he wrong?
@eonline   this is going to be the best
@eonline  maybe people are tired of using these events as a forum and having everything turned into a statement. Ruined again #Oscars
@eonline  well I thought it would be cool to have him hosting but now he will probably be replaced by someone else.
@eonline  i am sick and tired of this diversity crap. Is it possible the best actors won?nothing to do with race just talent
@eonline  "White BET Awards"
@eonline  I can't believe the Academy would let  @chrisrock  deface the prestige of these awards. May the best win regardless of race. #Oscars
@eonline  Chris is not done yet. He's going to make the oscars worth watching.
@chrisrock ,  @eonline , wait, I could be wrong, but I believe diversity is an old, old wooden ship that was used during the Civil War era.
@eonline ,  @chrisrock , good point. How can there be a BET Awards Show and yet no one complains about a lack of diversity on that show?
@eonline , and if  @chrisrock  feels this way then why doesn't he stand up for the black entertainers and boycott the show? #MoneyTalks
@eonline  . #BETAwards are all exclusive. How is that any different? Just cuz they CALL it all black? It's reverse discrimination.
@eonline  If he does that show, his career is over. Listen to your fans.

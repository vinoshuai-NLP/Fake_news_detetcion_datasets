@CNN  Most assuredly not! Ms. Davis has a true commitment to God and His Word. The Pope has a true commitment to his lavish lifestyle and $$.
@CNN  the things we make news worthy just baffle ones mind, find a solution to Oregon like issues
@CNN  then how should we consider it? A show of...???
@CNN  If there was the possibility of his visit to her being misconstrued, why do it, in the 1st place? A PUBLICITY-STUNT, pure and simple.
@CNN  Back-tracking, American politician style.
@CNN  blah blah blah, we worry about shit like this instead of the real #ProblemsInAmerica that need fixed.
@CNN  why are either of these idiots getting any coverage
@CNN  how can it not be perceived as support? Pope will meet so few people while he is here. And Kim Davis is one. Hugely disappointing.
@CNN  Agree!  She represents her self, not the agency that she works for!!
@CNN  A church desperate to look cool is a sad thing
@CNN  She just needs to go away
@CNN  I'll believe that when #PopeFrancis meets with leaders of the #lgbt community The #Pope sent a clear message by meeting with #KimDavis
@CNN  then what should it be considered? Unless he performed an exorcism on that witch, it will be considered support. #getreal
@CNN  no he basically said we are both going to hell
@CNN  So what is it? With God there is no sitting on the wall
@CNN  Too late for this...
@CNN  Of course it's a form of support! It just shouldn't have any impact on our political policies.  He supported the death row inmate too
@CNN  With that meeting, the Pope sadly undid a great deal of what his visit was.
@CNN  Same with his stance on climate change.... #TRUMP2016
@CNN  Then exactly how should the meeting be considered?  @Pontifex  shouldn't have met with #KimDavis to begin with. Rewarded bad behavior.
@CNN  Pope has to stay neutral, We knew this, people are spewing hate & negativity jumping to conclusions, Shameful & disgusting for America!
@CNN  Pope Francis may have spoke against Jesus Christ but he is not stupid enough to take a STAND on NONSENSE by the Kentucky Clerk
@CNN  I bet it was more like the pope saying whom is this obnoxious bitch and do I really have to talk to her
@CNN  Funny how someone is inevitably going to spin it to be...
@CNN  Apostolic Christian-make sure you are BAPTIZE of your many sins and PARTAKE of the Sacrament-
@CNN  Go to Catholic Church every Sunday or LDS-Mormon to partake of Sacrament or Holy Communion since your FAITH dont serve it every Sunday
@CNN  why the hell not
@CNN  Simply stop talking about her
@hndavis12  @CNN  1 of the great things about this pope is he doesn't care about appearances. Maybe he was modeling peace & forgiveness
@southern_bel  @hndavis12  @CNN  If he doesn't care about appearances, why spin the visit? It was ill conceived and looked terrible for Pope.
@CNN  I really believe and love to see people do what they believe in
@CNN  but what I heard on news..it seems it was a form of support..it was said that the pope told her she had rights like that which is b.s
@CNN  her supporters had the contacts with papal hierarchy to get this set up - those supporters keeping it in the news
@CNN  what else would it be?  I should have had a private mtg if this the case. #hogbitch
@CNN  What is it then? Does Catholic church support homosexuality? Does it conduct gay marriages?
@CNN  so if all the military and police who protected him on his US  visit refused to do their job  based on religious beliefs is that ok?

@200prf  @nytimes  @WhiteHouse  @BarackObama  Abortion is good. It keeps unwanted welfare babies from taking my tax dollars.
@nytimes  Not to be repetitive, been saying Vigano responsible for Kim Davis fiasco for days!!
@nytimes  now what's the difference who did first
@nytimes  dont really uderstand what pope and our tax dollars and government have to do with each other. Separation church and state. Constit
@nytimes  here is video of the audience.  it was reported in Argentina. http://9ahora.com.ar/2015/09/exclusivo-2/video-mira-el-encuentro-entre-francisco-y-un-paranaense/…
@nytimes  Because he doesn't hate gays any more than Kim Davis does. But, he does believe marriage is one man and one woman.
@nytimes  so what?why is this even news at all?you think the Pope never met any other gay people?
@nytimes  Did he or did he not meet with this woman? He did meet with her, that's an endorsement of her behaviour.
@mock_ing_bird  @nytimes   You don't know the nature of the meeting so I can hardly see how that counts as an endorsement.
@nytimes  the Pope made it quite clear,he doesn't support Kim Davis or her followers in any way
@nytimes  Does this redeem him for seeing Davis? Pope Met With Same-Sex Couple During U.S. Visit http://inquisitr.com/2465390/pope-met-with-same-sex-couple-during-u-s-visit/…
@nytimes  not some random gay man, a former student of Francis. This is not the political equivalent of a meeting with Kim Davis.
@nytimes  Pope seems like he is a great guy.  But he's still a grown man who believes in Santa Claus
@nytimes - SHAME on you NYT for yet again misleading the public. The world is still suffering consequences of your misleading us into Iraq.
@nytimes  Added your tweet to my  @RebelMouse  http://rbl.ms/1OQ18jL

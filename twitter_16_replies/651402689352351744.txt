@kbswan  @Starbucks  @WhiteHouse  that's a great idea.
@Starbucks  35,000 homeless, poverty level, hungry people in the rural south of America. 15 percent in the state of Arkansas alone! Europe?
@Starbucks  How abut the refugee camps we call Reservations in this country. A disgrace!
@Starbucks  @WhiteHouse  Let's look for a solution for drought in California (there are people without drinking water) & excess water in SC.
@Starbucks  No thank you.
@Starbucks  @WhiteHouse  REMEMBER STARBUCKS DONT WANT YOUR BUSINESS IF YOU BELIEVE IN TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE 
@k9rotts  When did  @Starbucks  say that? They didn't. If it weren't for lies bigots & trolls would do zero thinking.
@Starbucks  @WhiteHouse  STARBUCKS DOESNT WANT YOUR BUSINESS IF U BELIEVE IN TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE 
@Starbucks  @WhiteHouse  @UN  Why not ask wealthy Gulf States + Israel to take some #migrants #refugees ? They have take none, why ?
@Starbucks  --Feed them! And they will ALWAYS come back for MORE! ..Shame on you Starbucks! instead looking after hungry Americans!
@Starbucks  Keep your money in America. We have homeless and hungry here!
@Starbucks  BOYCOTT STARBUCKS!!!
@Starbucks  nice sentiment. I feel 4 refugees 2. How bout u use ur $$$$$$$$$$$ to help our own people first? 2 much 2 ask?
@Starbucks  what about helping the needy in the US? The rest of the world depend on the USA and we never get respect!
@Starbucks  except those are not refugees. They left camps so they won't get conscripted by Assad
@Starbucks  how about people in  USA
@Starbucks  love to help, but I'm not a fan of the Red Cross.
@Starbucks  why doesn't Starbucks support US troops by sending them coffee. That's ok I won't support Starbucks anymore
@Starbucks  Gee. Why no pictures of the military aged men, who are the majority of these "refugees" invading Europe.

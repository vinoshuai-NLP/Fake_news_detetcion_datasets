@Dbargen  @RebootLiberty  @ColorMeRed  why is the media saying 350 mass shooting this year?
@politicsinmemes  @inthe250  @lear_shane  @POTUS  @Dbargen  @RavenHUWolf  @RebootLiberty  After Dunblane, UK enforced strict gun laws. None since.
@politicsinmemes  @ColorMeRed  @POTUS  @Dbargen  @RavenHUWolf  @RebootLiberty  What? No Chicago? Hard to believe.
@Dbargen  @RebootLiberty   Could they be doing the job that O wants them to do ????
@Dbargen  @RebootLiberty  Because he promised to and has fundamentally changed America.
@inthe250  homicide happens everywhere. Why should I sacrifice my personal protection and right for feel goods?
@inthe250  and I am not immune. I have lost 3 family to gun violence. But I am logical in my response to it.
@inthe250  @politicsinmemes  it would be a good start. We need policy to grow our economy, educate not indoctrinate, & mental health vs HIPPA
@inthe250  that is fair. I think honesty about current laws and availability are worth discussion. Just not a jump to ban or control more
@inthe250  yes I did broad brush there. But obamas universal bG check is just a federal database. We have state registered and FBI checks
@inthe250  the attack on personal ownership of firearms is an attack on personal protection.
@Dbargen  @RebootLiberty " Ever Wonder Why The Most MassShootingsEverHave Happened Under Obama?" All the time, and I speculate a lot  as well.
@Dbargen  @RebootLiberty  That's a bullshit story..lmao..Go back..try again...lmfao!! Idiot
@Dbargen  @JMontanaPOTL  @RebootLiberty
would love to hear  @WhiteHouse  tap dance around this. Val? Susan? Josh? anybody? anybody?  @Dbargen  @JMontanaPOTL  @RebootLiberty

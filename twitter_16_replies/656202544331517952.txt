@PolitiFact  Uh, it most certainly *was* accessible via the CNN website. That's how I got there. I don't visit CNN's Facebook site directly.
@PolitiFact  when I click on where you claim the poll still is. Nice job.
@SubyWill  When I follow the link on a phone, I get the same. It works on my desktop, though.  @PolitiFact  was half-correct on this one.
@PolitiFact  who is Internet? Its pretty well understood that they didn't delete the poll, just tried to hide the truth that Bernie won
@PolitiFact  I am not a FarceBork user, so the only way I would have seen it is via their main site, which is precisely what I did.
@PolitiFact   You based this on 10/19/15 and not 10/13/15 - 10/14/15 when the MSM was declaring Hillary the winner? You lost all credibility.
@PolitiFact  As such, I rate your claim Half True. Pretty lousy for a supposed fact-checking organization. -.-
@ArchaeanDragon  @PolitiFact  Agree with everyone else is. At best this is HALF true, as I ALSO took the poll ON CNN's SITE, not their FB.
@PolitiFact  re: Bernie poll. I think there was two polls going on at same time.  One through FB on on website. Also, your link to poll broke
@PolitiFact  @KatieLSanders  Wrong! Check your own links. Respect your trade. Respect we the people. #FeelTheBern
@PolitiFact  well looks like you guys are paid by cnn too. Because indeed it was. It was. It was. It was. Oh and it definitely WAS
@PolitiFact  The poll was posted on CNN's website, then later that night was moved to CNN I Report as "not verified by CNN", say screenshot.
@PolitiFact  If all polls, "snap polls" on debate night had Bernie winning, why didn't CNN commentators mention this? Pathetic Reporting.
@PolitiFact  @deadhead1991    You Lie!

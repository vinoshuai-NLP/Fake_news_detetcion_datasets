@JCooper459  there is a vote to send relief money for natural disaster?
yes there is.
Can you say "bad karma"?
Someone in Congress should propose an amendment: These guys' own homes shall not receive any federal aid.  @latimes
100% of politicians that voted against Katrina aid were Republicans.
@ChristineIAm   Funny how the shoe is on the other foot now. Guess karma really is a bit$h. Couldn't happen to nicer people. LoL.
I have always said tha., God has a delicious sense of humor.
Preach!!!!
@Omagus  hmmmm
I seen this coming,,Obama give them everything they wanted under his power NOW they have to get more funding from this congress lol
@awebbiz  Karma?
same  @SteveScalise  who is demanding flood aid now 
@KagroX  fuck them all.
"These Republicans"...
@WillMcAvoyACN  Of course they are...
@AndreaHolsomba2  well ,they're stoo-pid..each family will receive 7,500 per household and as high as 33,000$
eventually your past & ideology catch up with you. An embarrassment
I don't like Christie, but he should call them out.
Can anyone put names on these scowling faces?
Shoe, meet other foot.
@DrShepherd2013  oh well- not surprising
@awebbiz  the federal government is the GOPs enemy, until they need a friend!   #SwampFox  
they are beholden to gas and oil industry.. those are the guys who destroyed Louisiana wetlands. monsters
What goes around. comes around... js
Sandy was one of worst experiences of my life. I resent those who chose not to help as 'New Yorkers are rich'. Grrrr
@Ivanroberson  Hypocrites!

@keithincali  
Still more evidence of how the #GOP obstructs and prevents positive action. This time it may bite back.
@robingsmith  so let's punish the poor and flooded out in La to get even even with their Legislators? Nice job Hiltzik.

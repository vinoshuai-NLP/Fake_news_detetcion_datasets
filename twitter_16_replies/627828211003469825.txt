@BuzzFeed  I guess stairs aren't an option in China
@buzzfeed  what if your legs not long enough to do that grounded forever
@BuzzFeed  here's an idea... take the stairs
@BuzzFeed     couldn't they just take the stairs??
@BuzzFeed  Please Check out this:
@Elijah_Tovey  @BuzzFeed  @George_0305  @jamesdd10  @ChengWeiMing  @tantanwillow  @SueJG15  don't you think they'll get hurt quicker doing this?
@Elijah_Tovey  @George_0305  @jamesdd10  @ChengWeiMing  @tantanwillow  @SueJG15  reminds me of a friend of mine who slid down an escalator rail!
@Elijah_Tovey  @George_0305  @jamesdd10  @ChengWeiMing  @tantanwillow  @SueJG15  he flew face first onto the escalator & had to get a tetanus shot
@Elijah_Tovey  @BuzzFeed  @George_0305  @jamesdd10  @ChengWeiMing  @tantanwillow  @SueJG15  so I hope these people are careful!!! 
@BuzzFeed  or just take the stairs

Lol " @BuzzFeed : This is how people in China are riding escalators after a horrific accident http://bzfd.it/1IsJbF2 "
@BuzzFeed  why wouldn't they just take the stairs?

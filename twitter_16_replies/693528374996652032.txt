@FoxNews  @RealBenCarson  I sure like Ben Carson. He's such a good man Wish we could bring all the best of the nominees together to fix the US
@FoxNews  @RealBenCarson  ASK THE CLINTONS
@FoxNews  @RealBenCarson  I would still love to see a Trump/Carson ticket.
@FoxNews  @RealBenCarson  and that there is the problem, they don't have the whole world they just think they do
@FoxNews  @RealBenCarson  he is the one most qualified to answer that, besides  @tedcruz  @marcorubio  @CarlyFiorina  and  @GovMikeHuckabee
@FoxNews  @RealBenCarson  So true, too many don't even think beyond their life on earth or what that can mean for them.
@FoxNews  Love  @RealBenCarson  but the best thing he could do 4 USA is Cruz to VP
@FoxNews  @RealBenCarson  He's right about that. The Lord doesn't want to hear about your bank account when you meet with him.
@FoxNews  @RestoreHistory  @RealBenCarson  Proven leadership, a Citizen Statesman, & a tax plan praised by Steve Forbes
@FoxNews  @RealBenCarson  Everything I know to be true from my teacher and moral compass can be found in this man Jerry Falwell Jr.

@TheOnion  This is what Trump is doing to the Republican Party. Not that I'm complaining. ;)

@TheOnion  @OrcaSOS  WTF? Is this true?
@H4RR12  @TheOnion  @iamjoebobula  Some idiot on facebook and apparently about 2,000 people on twitter 
@TheOnion  elephants can swim ...
@TheOnion  I'm dead at reading the replies here. How did some of you get this far in life?
@TheOnion  noo
@TheOnion  I think this is what they do at the Copenhagen SeaWorld.
Not real  @BudweiserGirl  but  @TheOnion  never fails to make their point!  #SeaWorld #CaptivityKILLS #Blackfish
@OrcaSOS  'world class entertainment'   @BudweiserGirl  @TheOnion
@TheOnion  @syrupf  no proof that it would have lived longer in the wild
@TheOnion  wow fantastic
@TheOnion  @amartinez553
@TheOnion  In front of 1,000's of people in the Shamu stadium? Speciesist Shamu! No help to pachyderms 3x a day, or killing 21 dumbos a week!
@TheOnion  In Shamu Stadium? Did Shamu just let those pachyderms die without lifting a fluke in help? Death toll: 21 Dumbos/week, 1,068/yr.!
@TheOnion  damn this one got me
@TheOnion  @underworldimage  Let's see how many idiots start rallying against Sea World for this story.  #trolling
@TheOrcaProject  @TheOnion  what the? This is allowed? Is anyone accountable? Probably not.
@BeyounceR5  nah it's a fake article... The Onion is parody news (but, it's still funny)
@TheOnion  @danwishart  Reminds me of Chris Morris
@arganoid  @TheOnion  yes I can imagine him reading the headline
@TheOnion  
@TheOnion  FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON THIS IS THE MOST SICK THING I EVER SEEN AN TO TAKE A CHILD WHY 
@TheOnion  Sea World would still find a way to say that the elephants are well treated and healthy.
@TheOnion  @DanielRivero27  not true lol my sister works there

Elephants don't drown.  @TheOnion
@TheOnion  #sea world is horrible for doing this!!  Disgusting!!

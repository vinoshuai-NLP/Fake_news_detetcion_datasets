@MichaelSavoca  @CNN  I apologize. I didn't realize  @HillaryClinton  was blazing her own path. Seems she's following in  @SenSanders  footsteps.
@CNN  @HillaryClinton  @BernieSanders  CNN is full of shit
@MichaelSavoca  each poll is associated with the media outlet that released it.  @CNN  @Drudge  @FoxNews  @Time  @Slate

@CNN  @HillaryClinton  @BernieSanders  Funny how a Clinton News Network poll finds that result. #DemDebate
@CNN  I didn't get the memo that CNN was listening to polls anymore? Isn't NH just young voters on that BS called social media?
@CNN  @HillaryClinton  @BernieSanders  yeah that'll happen when you have a media bias towards hillary and declare her winner when she wasnt.

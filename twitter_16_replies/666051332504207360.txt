@NRO  Should see if he can sue to stop them.
@NRO  Bus'em to Dc
@NRO  @slone  protest my ass.  . @BobbyJindal  needs some balls & send the planes or boats back & do not let them off! He writes a letter. . Lol
@sevigny_rob  @theironicview  @NRO  @slone  @BobbyJindal  Dunce!
@NRO  #ObamaResign
@NRO  Well, Bobby, expressions of concern and protest won't stop it. What are you going to DO?
@NRO  Wash. DC doesn't give a shit we the people don't  want ANY middle eastern  refugees coming to OUR country don't trust there identity
@NRO  I would too. Send these ISIS infiltrated refugees to Chicago so BHO'S town can enjoy them.
@NRO  A governor no longer has any power in the American governmental system.
@NRO  @patrickmadrid  They r invaders not refugees. Mostly men
@NRO  @patrickmadrid  ascend national guard to contain them & send back to Middle East
@NRO  Thanks for sharing! It's now featured on http://rbl.ms/1CozKTM
@NRO  @LyndaG1963  All an act. Why didn't he stop it like MI Gov Snyder did. He could have, now he cries about it? BS
@NRO  @lr3031  one wonders if BHO and his DHS are rewarding outspoken Republican Governors with 10,000 Syrian refugees apiece.
@NRO  then why did he agree in the 1st place?

@AnnCoulter  @BreitbartNews  America is an oligarchy of special interests. When 2% of the population dictates social norms something's wrong.
@AnnCoulter  At 1.4 millionthat's double the number of Transgenders in USA. Target better decide if it's Family Friendly or Trans friendly.
@AnnCoulter  The left loves to boycott, lets not join them in that, lets just throw our support to business that values the safety of kids ;)
@AnnCoulter  @MattWalshBlog  hypocrite Coulter. Your boy endorses targets policy

@AnnCoulter  @MattWalshBlog  We should boycott  @AnnCoulter  next for being a Trumpologist.
@TheRealGwampy  @AnnCoulter  @MattWalshBlog  There needs to be a purge of phony conservatives like Ann after this election.
@Emmanue58764841  @AnnCoulter  @MattWalshBlog  Trump stated it should be left up to the States to decide. Cruz position is a play for votes.
@AnnCoulter  @MattWalshBlog  2.5b is just 5% of their mkt cap. Seems like a lot; not to target. they were this low 4/11 & rebounded #KeepGoing
@AnnCoulter  But Trump is ok with it. Please make up your mind.

@AnnCoulter  @CruzinMich2016  @BreitbartNews
@AnnCoulter  @Jim_Peoples_ We would stand w/those who agree w/r views &oppose those who oppose r views n a free civil society bc it's right.
@JolenesTrailer  target employees who are parents get sacrifice 4 children's safety. Some understand protecting kids even tho is will cost.
@AnnCoulter  @MattWalshBlog  Why not start with boycotting Catholic Churches where children are actually sexually abused? #equality
@AnnCoulter  I pick ESPN in June.
@AnnCoulter    Well that's just a shame cuz LGBT's deserve to rid their bodies of waste anywhere they please with whomever they please.
@AnnCoulter  @MattWalshBlog  we should boycott Trump next.
@stevepate13  @AnnCoulter  @MattWalshBlog  Go ahead and give it a try. Cruz and Kasich have already been boycotted, the people do not want them
@AnnCoulter  Need 2 findout what's behind decision which lets perverts into womens bathroons. Mothers take guard!Convert transgenders maybe
@AnnCoulter  @pc53lang  I am with u Ann. I watch everywhere I spend money. I am not supporting BS liberals if I can help it.
@AnnCoulter  @lynn_weiser  I Agree with the Target Boycott.  What are they thinking.  I hate it though,  Cause I like shopping at Target.
@tweetmyavonguy  @AnnCoulter  We have to vote with our feet sometimes.
@AnnCoulter  I went to a home depot bathroom. I reluctantly went in. All the stalls were dirty.  Moral, use the bathroom before leaving home.
@joycee_NH  @JDHCrenshaw  @AnnCoulter  Did you notice the tiny bulges from the tucked weenies in the panties from these hordes of people?
@AnnCoulter  @BreitbartNews  that's all?? We need to get those numbers up a lot higher
@joycee_NH  @JDHCrenshaw  @AnnCoulter  You people?
@AnnCoulter  All retail stocks are down today, but Target LEAST of all = they're doing BETTER than most other retailers. #mathwins

@AnnCoulter  agree
@AnnCoulter  @BashemB  Target is p-ssing in its pants over bathroom stance.
@JolenesTrailer  @AnnCoulter  @BreitbartNews  it was Targets decision to get political just to please .03% of people over a bathroom.
@JolenesTrailer  @AnnCoulter  @BreitbartNews  don't blame stupid business decisions on others. Was a dumb move and over a million disagree.

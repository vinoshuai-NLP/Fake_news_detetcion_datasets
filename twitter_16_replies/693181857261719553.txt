@hoophops  @espn  the game is a safe, it says diagnosed. There was probably just as many, or more in previous years. Awareness is better
@hoophops  @espn  now so naturally more diagnosed concussions would happen. More players are willing to admit when they are concussed now
@espn  how about instead of making the rules more strict, we use some of those billion for helmet research
@espn  how much longer until the nfl is extinct bc of what it can happen to the brain? Money vs health??
@espn  @angusreid64  I heard 58%??
@espn  evals r getting better. Concussions have always been there. We r just bettr @ finding it. I say there r less 2day then there used 2 b
@espn  key word in this title is "diagnosed" ...they're not happening more frequently, but medical staff is doing more to be aware of them
@Advil  this just made me like you 100x more
@espn  "So?  All the footballs were properly inflated..." - R. Goodell
@espn  yeah thanks will smith
@espn  In related news, Assumption of Risk applies to ALL PARTICIPANTS of ALL SPORTS.
@espn  @mikerothstein  - Gues that reads better than "Concussions up 3.8% since 2012"
@espn  @mikerothstein  - Not that I knock the guy for choosing the first title. Surprised it jumped after a decline.
@espn  any record on exactly who was reported with concussions? Interesting to see if #s varied for "lesser" players vs top ranked on teams
@espn  @BrittMcHenry  They began tracking practice concussions.
@espn  Wondering if this was due to the increase in education, rule changes, the addition of independent neurologists; all or none?
@espn  they're happening in basketball too. More than you would think. I've had 5. 4 as a collegiate athlete.
@espn  well seeing as how they are forcing people to report them now obviously the number will go up.
@espn  Are they truly up or just reported more now because of the awareness?!!!
@espn  better diagnosing is probably the reason for this.
@espn  may be a bit skewed due to more awareness.  Who knows how many went unreported in past years.
@espn  probably because they are taking the right measurements to make sure players get checked right away, they're catching them earlier
@espn  Hey here's an idea. Remember Pop Warner football, don't lead with your head. Football rule 101. Just sayin
@espn  @BrittMcHenry  New helmets needed
@espn  how 'bout boxing? Or don't those in the ring ever get concussions? Wonder what Mohamed Ali would have to say to that?

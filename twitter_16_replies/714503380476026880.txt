@johnfund  @xojanedotcom  @RichLowry  "Top Strategist"?
@kausmickey  @johnfund  @xojanedotcom  @RichLowry  "But a year has now passed since I was first approached to become part of Team Trump"  Who?
@Bateslawfirm  Trump has absolutely no chance to beat Hillary or Bernie's in the GE...100% the worst candidate in a generation #nevertrump
@johnfund  @xojanedotcom  I agree WOW
@johnfund  @xojanedotcom  @SCegielskiPR  sorry it took you so long to see what a lot of us saw from the beginning of this nightmare. Welcome.
@johnfund  @RichLowry  @xojanedotcom  Long story short: Trump fired her and she is disgruntled.
@johnfund  @RINOPundit  @xojanedotcom  Does she now realize the entire conservative "movement" is a scam?
@johnfund  @TeaParty4Cruz  @xojanedotcom  @SCegielskiPR  wow
@johnfund  @RichLowry  @xojanedotcom  is this a joke this top strategist has barely a positive tweet for trump at all!
@johnfund  @tgradous  @xojanedotcom  @SCegielskiPR  Trump renounced at the get-go any SuperPac saying they support him....

@johnfund  @CruzCash2016  @xojanedotcom  @SCegielskiPR  And Trump will NEVER build a wall, simply insult ppl and turn back into the Dem he is.
@johnfund  @GRAA_LA  @xojanedotcom  @SCegielskiPR   Read the entire thing. 2/3 of it applies to every CEO &/or politician I've ever met. Boring

@johnfund  @jmhardt1  @xojanedotcom  @SCegielskiPR  except, it's completely false  She's a spurned super PAC loser
@CnPlayground  It's false because you pulled my LinkedIn profile?

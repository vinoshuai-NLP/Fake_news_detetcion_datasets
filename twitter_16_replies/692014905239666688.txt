@cnnbrk  what this photo actually meant is: Give me your money or I'll deport your ass. Well played world.
@cnnbrk  wow...
@cnnbrk  Because it's easy to beat a dead horse!
@cnnbrk  weird
@keys_18_keys If you actually read the article you would know that such items are exempt.
@cnnbrk  good
@cnnbrk  check your facts CNN!!! But your journalists suck on that!!!!
@cnnbrk  Amazing! Datz no more help, it's a trade(maybe by barter). . .
@keys_18_keys Fair deal? Gov. provide free health care, education, elderly care, langauge training etc.
@cnnbrk  That's mean.
@cnnbrk  Jesus. And they think  @realDonaldTrump  is bad.
@cnnbrk  Denmark does the same thing to their own people who are using the governments assistant!  Lefties, figure it out, nothing is free!
. @cnnbrk  Bernie Sandernista's beloved Denmark shows its fangs.
@cnnbrk  I would love to read this but your ads make it impossible. No way to even exit them. I will get news elsewhere.
@cnnbrk . History repeating itself. Denmark grab their belongings and in UK they're provided with food if they're wearing an armband.
@cnnbrk  that's terrible better to send them home with their stuff or welcome them
@cnnbrk  @David_Cameron  - the question is when will the UK do the same!!
@cnnbrk  . Next stop, concentration camp !
@cnnbrk  Robin Hood in reverse.
@cnnbrk  @bbc  - BBC take note not so controversial it didn't pass.
@cnnbrk  @KTHopkins  @TheFive
@cnnbrk  disgusting...but not surprising!
@cnnbrk  that is sick
@cnnbrk  how the hell is this going to cover costs? Who in their right mind wants to buy stuff seized from poor people?!
@cnnbrk  - Everyday the world finds ways to remind me why it is such a terrible place.
@cnnbrk  Will they be taking gold fillings and shaving long hair to sell as well? This is sad.
@cnnbrk  just saw brking news abt Doctor shld Scrn for depression in all patients I take offense another way to get pple on ths dif drugs
@Jobbe03  @cnnbrk  I disagree with both. If you were layed off you'd be ok with the gov taking your personal items to pay your unemployment?
@Jobbe03  @cnnbrk  In the US both employees and employers pay into unemployment tax so that its there when needed.
. @cnnbrk  wow, that's fucked. "We know you left with only the things on your back but.....hand over anything of value and you can stay".
@cnnbrk  Those evil bourgeoisie-refugee Muslims!
@cnnbrk  stop your leftist propaganda. Not all values taken . family of 4 can retain over 6,000 euros. Danes must also pay
@cnnbrk  How many refugees does the United States receive from the Middle East? Do not talk bad about others when you yourself do nothing
@cnnbrk  remember. Before Danes get social unemployment benefits they have to use their savings until the 10000kr treshold
@Jobbe03  @cnnbrk  I do realize your not treating them as human beings and labeling them different then yourself. You'd be a great Trumpy here
@cnnbrk  WELCOME TO THE DARK SIDE OF HUMANITY
@cnnbrk  the term Nazism comes to mind

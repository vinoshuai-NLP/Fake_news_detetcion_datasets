@Annie53P The people who should really b cautious r the transgenders since they get murdered at a r8 similar to soliders on the front lines.
@Annie53P It's not an assumption it's a fact. One in twelve transgendered persons are murdered.
@Annie53P All the bathroom bills will do is inspire witch hunts while utterly failing to protect anyone.
@Annie53P IKR! It's almost unreal how bad they have it.
@JoeGunz42  @Annie53P it's almost unreal how stupid people keep encouraging that kind of behavior
@RyseOfDamocles  @snopes  @Target  Transgender mainly, so they're letting men into women restrooms and vice versa. Terrible either way, IMO.
@snopes  @Target  ok everyone settle down. 1 if they're trans, they're f not m and unless they're gay then they won't come after you.
@snopes  @Target  2 Moms have been bringing their "boys" into women's restrooms for years. I've seen them where they are easily 13+ years old
@snopes  @Target Fabulous
@snopes  @Target  So much for Snopes pretense of objectivity on this issue! But that ship has sailed: http://watersblogged.blogspot.com/2016/04/snopescoms-dishonest-distortion-of.htmlâ€¦
@snopes   I notice that when one copies the embed code for this post, the prejudicial comment about the policy being "fabulous" disappears.
@snopes  @Target  cool as .... x
@ta11gir1 You're right. I don't know jack-shit about the whole surgery aspect. I just assumed one would be able to tell the diffrence.
@Annie53P  @snopes  @Target  Bigot much? Target's a great company. Kudos to them for NOT being bigots like sadly, some of their customers

@AllenWest  @kumtam1 Let 'em eat each other. What I know about these animals they will when they're hungry enough.
@AllenWest  Bunch of FOOLS
@AllenWest  Guess then they can go to "hell-all"!
@AllenWest  Identify those waving the food off. They likely are the ISIS/Al-Qaeda operatives.
@AllenWest  #Jihadists
@AllenWest  @Radio_Spunky_UK # Are these the people you want in your Country, I don't send them home.
@AllenWest  there are actual desperate Americans who would LOVE to have this food.
@AllenWest  this is a Trojan horse strategy on waiting to unfurl on sleepy naive nations. WAKE UP PEOPLE!!!
@AllenWest  The West is being played big time. I guess when they're hungry they will eat.
@AllenWest  The US should concentrate on the Christians&Yazzidis refugees.They are more at risk,we have sponsors4both&take less time2vet.
@AllenWest  it's not the food they want, its our country
@AllenWest  we accomplished greatness in a little over 200 years what they couldn't do in a 1000 years
@AllenWest  Despicable. These people are invaders, similar to a virus or disease. Send them to the palaces in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar.
@AllenWest  @ChrizDDv3  send their butts where they came from
@AllenWest  Let them starve then who cares
@AllenWest  & throwing bottled water on train tracks/people, throwing food on ground provided by other charities, & destroying property, etc
. @AllenWest  man these people need to be sent right back to the cesspool from whence they came.
@AllenWest   Where are all the women, children or old people? Hmmm. Don't want to eat it? Then starve. On their way to a city near you.
@AllenWest  @peddoc63  ok they don't want our help ,,,,don't offer it again

@AllenWest  @peddoc63   I saw 1 or 2 kids, mostly men, yes, let them starve, WTF are we doing, they are coming here ppl, just a matter of time
@AllenWest  Guess they can starve to death. Feed 'em bacon...
@AllenWest  the Koran states that Muslims are allowed to suspend halal guidelines if their is no halal food available, even told to eat pork.
@AllenWest  they are not refugees, but terrorists pretending so they can get into other countries
@AllenWest  @peddoc63  My1st thought was what about little Abdullah in school?Prayer time?Special Diets?Not a good outlook for assimilation
@AllenWest  @DrottM  let 'em eat mud.
@AllenWest  @CITIncUS Time to offer hot lead.

@AllenWest  I agree.  I always beleive Kosher food is the best.
@1beaumiller  @AllenWest  Agreed. Especially since they're NOT all "refugees".
@AllenWest  @Seth66Owens They put two fingers up to the food that is presented to them!
@AllenWest  @c5hardtop1999  They refused Red Cross food offered by the Macedonian army because it's not halal, I say, screw em, let em starve!
@SCOOPNJ78  @AllenWest  Strange because who are protecting women and children? Something not right about this.

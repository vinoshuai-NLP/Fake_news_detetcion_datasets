“ @thehill : White House lights up rainbow colors to celebrate SCOTUS ruling http://hill.cm/unKi4b0 ” can't make this up

@thehill  @RosieBarton  Sometimes there seems no place as progressive as the USA. Today is one of those times. Revel in its temporary elation.
@thehill  @RosieBarton  How wonderful!

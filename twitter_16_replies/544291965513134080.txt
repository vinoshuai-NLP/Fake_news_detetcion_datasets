@SharriMarkson  who do you think you’re “informing”?
@SharriMarkson  Sure hope it's not just some dude and that you've not just pulled a Fairfax. Beginning to see why you were sent back to uni.
@pearlyfootball  @SharriMarkson  @australian  put a bullet in the wankers head
@SharriMarkson    You are a danger to the rest of society. Stop posting pics without any verification & creating panic.
@SharriMarkson  @australian
@SharriMarkson  Yeah, Murdoch witch, shut up and watch the blinking lights. You're not a journo, so don't journalise.
@SharriMarkson  get the snipers to that spot
. @SharriMarkson  ARE YOU HIGH? How is it appropriate to tweet a photo of a live police operation?
@maevegobash  @MolksTVTalk  @SharriMarkson  stick to reporting TV news and leave the real news to the professionals #sydneysiege
@rodneycruise  @noplaceforsheep  @SharriMarkson  I'm not watching it, but it sounds as if it is being treated as sport.
@pearlyfootball  @SharriMarkson  @australian  there's 2 of them though
@pearlyfootball exactly what i was thinking
@rodneycruise  @noplaceforsheep  @SharriMarkson  It's called Dunning-Kruger effect. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect…
@SharriMarkson  @australian  why are you not abiding by NSW Police request not to post images relating to the siege on social media?!
“ @SharriMarkson : According to Seven, this is a picture of the gunman ”
@SharriMarkson  any sniper would love that shot!
@SharriMarkson  what is wrong with you? are you mentally disabled?

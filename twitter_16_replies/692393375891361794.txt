@WhiteHouse  Our household makes "Good" money...and we still make food the last thing to pay for at the end of the month. Groceries r costly!
@WhiteHouse  bull crap!Most people don't use them, they sell their food stamp cards,others abuse as well.White house is ignorant.
@WhiteHouse  - maybe we should help the economy buildup good paying jobs so we don't need a SNAP program
@WhiteHouse  @letsmove  some #SNAP recipients don't need the assistance. #Elderly folks need it for sure especially in the US #Territories.
@WhiteHouse  @letsmove  #SNAP recipients shouldn't give the card to the #beautician to charge the cost of a hair or nail job. How do we fix it
@WhiteHouse  @USDA  oh yeah more free handouts I wish I could get snap for my kids but I work for a living I guess I'm in the minority now....
The White House   Check out new steps we're taking to expand access  Thank you very much @WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse  don't they receive snap and welfare? Isn't that money supposed to go for food? Going to arrest the deadbeat parents?
@WhiteHouse  GMOs are a total failure! They promised cheap plentiful food they lied! It costs $160 for $60 worth of GMO contaminated garbage!
@WhiteHouse  O'dumba's latest label on us "food insecure household"? They love labeling us. We're just means to stay in power...a vote.
@WhiteHouse  yum
@czarfalcon  @KingofCaliforni  @whittierte  @WhiteHouse  @POTUS  always comparing roads to food and education. They don't come for the roads!
@WhiteHouse .

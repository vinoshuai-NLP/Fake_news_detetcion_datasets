@WhiteHouse  If Obama wants wage info. on other companies, they need to release their data--undoctored.
@WhiteHouse  I need to be paid as much as the man next to me. Regardless of my talents. Where can I get a vagina?
@WhiteHouse  bs
@WhiteHouse  This is a phony argument. Any determined woman can make as much as she wants in America.
Including in the  @WhiteHouse  @vj44 .  #Hippocrites.#EqualPay
@WhiteHouse  Equal pay system applied in Sudan since 1965
@WhiteHouse  http://bigstory.ap.org/urn:publicid:ap.org:e19abf78b6fe43e7b7719f059901630d…
@WhiteHouse  because they go into lower paying professions!  Here's one, my mother died when  @BarackObama  was President.  Same correlation.
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse  If this is actually a problem (it's not) why didn't Obama do something about it during his *two terms* as President?
@WhiteHouse  Citing this statistic without any context is misleading.
@WhiteHouse   up from $.0.77 in 1979.  At this pace, it will take 70 years for that next 23 cents.
@WhiteHouse  When will they stop telling this annoying lie?
@WhiteHouse  Equal pay has been the law for decades. You're pandering with a false narrative. http://eeoc.gov/laws/statutes/epa.cfm…
@WhiteHouse  Gee, you did such a bang-up job on healthcare...yeah, you've earned a shot at interfering in yet another area you don't belong
@WhiteHouse  I suppose no one ever lost a vote by underestimating the cupidity of the average American voter...
@TashaX42689  @WhiteHouse  your comment is irrelevant to the situation at hand
@WhiteHouse  That is untrue. This pay gap can only be created by ignoring relevant variables such as college major, hours worked, experience.
@WhiteHouse  NAW REALLY - OF COURSE HELP
@WhiteHouse   This bullshit statistic was discredited decades ago.
@WhiteHouse  Why do they get paid less? It can't be because of their gender. It's the 21st century! It makes no sense at all.
@WhiteHouse . The appendage  I use to pee shouldn't determine my paycheck. My pay should be based on the quality & quantity of my work.#Equal
@WhiteHouse  in 1978 women earned 58cents for every $1 men earned.  so in 38 years the gap has been closed by 20 cents.  a disgrace!
@WhiteHouse  This issue needs to be a priority for our next president!
@WhiteHouse  @ValaAfshar   I'm smarter & more productive than the men at work and get paid nearly twice as them. You have to at least be that.
@SamNationShow  @WhiteHouse  In The Sudan, women have a significant role in public life, they are powerful and successful,
@SamNationShow  @WhiteHouse  and now they have a majority in the civil service, education and public prosecutors...and other important  issues
@WhiteHouse   Do the American government get there wages cut when they go to there secret clubs and dress like women, or is it men's rates?
@WhiteHouse  This is not true, and this stat has been debunked by real research and data. Try $0.86 for every $1. The gap is choice, period.

@WhiteHouse  as long as men set the standard for raises, there is no equality . there is only "as good as the average male"

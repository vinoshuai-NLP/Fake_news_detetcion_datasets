@BuzzFeed  But hey, it's free range, sugar free, gluten free and from a non-conflict region, sold by living wage employees.
@BuzzFeed  @Mowgli3  I guess you can just combine any items and call it those two things, like Tire Pear or Atheism Pudding or Leaf Steak
@GetBullish  @BuzzFeed  @Mowgli3  or take a page from Charlie Kelly's book..... Milk Steak. 
@BuzzFeed  @Mowgli3  Wait, don't they stock that next to the reverse osmosis glacier melt bong water?
@BuzzFeed  I didn't even know I need this.
@BuzzFeed  Is the water made of Unicorn tears?
@BuzzFeed  vegetables soaking and sitting in water, is basically just dirty fungus and bacteria filled water...
@BuzzFeed  @maxformillions
@Cameron_fd  @BuzzFeed  let's not talk about it
@BuzzFeed  @CarrieeeSays wtf is this shit
@BuzzFeed  Ew. Just wait until the NYT decides to put peas on it
@BuzzFeed
@BuzzFeed  given that I dislike asparagus, I'd never even contemplate buying a product like this.   just nasty.
@BuzzFeed  @pad408 Bet it still makes your pee stink...
@BuzzFeed  @officialZoeBoss  pls buy me this on our next hotdog date

@BuzzFeed  @DonChampionTV  I have a great business plan if you want in: $7 carrot water.
@jsnewtonian  @BuzzFeed  those sound good though lol

Out of control RT  @BuzzFeed  Whole Foods' $6 asparagus water is just water with three stalks of asparagus in it http://eater.com/2015/8/3/9090797/whole-foods-asparagus-water-wtf…
@BuzzFeed  @chriscaple  article mentions "bone broth", that's all I need to know.
@BuzzFeed  @abbieploeser  nothing to write home about
@BuzzFeed  if people are willing to pay that much, they deserve that money.
@BuzzFeed  - and there are plenty of douchey people who are happy to buy it. Suckers deserve to be swindled.
@BuzzFeed  I've never heard of this and I work for Whole Foods.
@BuzzFeed   you get what you pay for

@espn  Dickie V and Brent are awesome!
@espn  Henry Ellenson finished with 32-10-6 blocks and y'all haven't mentioned it once. Simmons dunks and headline news.
@espn  "Big 12 superiority"
@gdjudge  @espn  correct, the Big 12 is the best conference in the nation for basketball.
@espn  @snewell0410  @Q_laughs
@espn  @DickieV  @TonyBrunoShow   It is great to hear Brent Musberger and Dick Vitale doing the LSU game tonight.  They still got it!
@espn  The game is a 'good news' 'bad news' event.  The basketball is good, then sound comes out of Vitale's mouth.
@espn  LSU looks great but Oklahoma slowly coming back, they seem methodical.
@espn  Dickie V's voice = #nailsonachalkboard
@Boomanchu73  @espn  only one of the top freshmen in the country
@espn  traveling
@espn  #Vitale sounded like he's never seen a reverse dunk before.  Oh and by a a kid who is 6' 10".  I'm sure it is a tough for Simmons
@espn  travel
@espn  dicky v the most annoying person in sports
@espn  @tyler_calvaruso
@sanzevino  @espn  Never forget Victor Oladipo is the next MJ
@espn  @Holt3
@glfcalloway9  @espn  Huh?
@espn  Dickie V sucks

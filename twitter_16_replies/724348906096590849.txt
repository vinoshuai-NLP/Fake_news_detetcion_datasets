@jlpa13  @FoxNews  @Target  The vast majority of Target stores DO have a 3rd restroom. It's why this topic is even more idiotic.
@FoxNews  @Target  #specialintrestgroupsruinthiscountry I'll still go to target!!!!!
@FoxNews  @Target  I'm not going to Boycott Target. Not using there bathrooms either. Going to pee and poop in the aisles. Clean up in aisle 3
@FoxNews  @Target  I have to go to Target today, what should I do?
@JuniesThread  @FoxNews  @Target  go.
@doug_pickell  @FoxNews  @Target  Dude. Any guy can follow your daughter into the bathroom.  It happens a lot without these laws.
@FoxNews  @Target  So I want these deviants bothering me as I pee and crap? Your children will ask why your supporting this crap, literally.
@FoxNews  hey  @target , can u please come out and say you won't discriminate against people of color as well, so we can thin out the herd more
@FoxNews  @Target  nice 340,000 out of 500,000,000 in the country! WOW
@FoxNews  @Target  Psh, those people are all WalMart shoppers anyway.
@FoxNews  @Target  But 339,000 may still shop there, and just not use the restroom...!!
@FoxNews  @Target  I wouldn't take my daughter to use the bathroom at target for sure. Hell or my son.
@FoxNews  @Target  340k idiots being irrational and don't know basic math or know that boys are more likely to be assaulted than girls (cont)
@FoxNews  @Target   Thank you. Shorter lines for the rest of us. Those 340K prob never shopped at Target anyways. #homophobes
@FoxNews  @Target  in a public restroom.
@FoxNews  @Target  Can a woman use the men's bathroom, or does Target discriminate?  Maybe I'll go find out.
@FoxNews  @Target  Any rules for using opp bathroom? Can a normal dressed, normal looking man use women's bathroom? Any1 can say they're tran
@FoxNews  @Target that's actually great think about it when your child is bothered, real deep pockets to sue --- I wish I went to law school
@FoxNews  @Target
@FoxNews  @Target  thank you for understanding that no Transgender person has ever used a public restroom as a way to abuse/assault someone.
@FoxNews  @Target   I hope it breaks target.
@FoxNews  @Target  Yeah, i'm going to have to side with the patrons over this also. The LGBT movement has gone too far with this one.
@FoxNews  @Target  I have a Target 4 minutes away from my home,needed clothes went 2Ross instead.Normally shop  @Target  but took my   elsewhere
@FoxNews  @Target   So they could go strictly online when you don't have problems with bathrooms or people face-to-face anymore
@FoxNews  @Target  Good.  Love shopping there when it's not crowded.
@FoxNews  Who gives a fuck what those christian nutjobs think. Good for  @Target  Who appointed AFA as guardian of morals?
@stephencarlin  @FoxNews  @Target  people who arent insane sickos thats who hahahaha
@FoxNews  @Target  Target doesn't care!  This is the same store that would not allow a drop off bin for toys for tots! Bernie supporters!
@FoxNews  @Target  ridiculous some of these transgender people you couldn't tell they were so parents accompany your children to the bathroom
@FoxNews  Hey  @Target  if you think this is important, spend $ and make all restrooms single user units and lose retail space! #talkischeap
@FoxNews  @Target  342,000
@FoxNews  @Target  Rightfully so. Have a GDaughter & I don't want a man posing as a woman in the same bathroom as her. #BoycottTarget.
@FoxNews  I have a better idea. Men should use women's room and women use men's room at target
@FoxNews  @Target  I believe it's time we start building a third gender bathroom policy. Each for Male/ female / others( transgenders).

@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews   About time too  How can we expect them to serve when there's tossers from the legal trading waiting for their return
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  but the lawyers will still be earning a wedge and still carrying out the british inquesition
@BBCBreaking  Placing any1, even #veterans, beyond prosecution serves the interests of no1 but a State who begets illegal wars! #law #crime
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Good! no win no fee lawyers hunting for 'victims' to come forward is wrong and rarely leads to real justice.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews     Of Course: USA & UK Regime; making Decisions Behind Closed Doors=(to justify Every past or Future Wars ) 
@bbcbreaking  How much is it going to cost the tax payers? And what is the cost for the case to be dropped?
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Common sense prevails. No soldier should have to go through this just for following orders.
@BBCBreaking  great news!

@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  does that mean there were no unlawful killings, we don't care if they were, or its all down to the fog of war.
@BBCBreaking  @NickyAACampbell  @BBCNews  for context, how many cases are proceeding?
@BBCBreaking  how much they paid them. .is it from TAX Money ?
@BBCBreaking  The MOD may want to brush these allegations under the carpet for political expediency but courts may take a different view.

@Heritage  I don't care if Target is the only store open after a tornado decimates our town, I wouldn't shop there! Sold our stocks!
@Heritage  We've used Amazon for shopping for months and never had to use Amazon's bathrooms once! LOL!
@Heritage  misguided?...idiotic
@Heritage  Quoting your own lie is hilarious in and of itself.  Anyway, the entire DOW was down, not just Target.  Don't lie to the people.
@Heritage  #BoycottTarget
@Heritage  failure to understand your customers, not a political POV just a POV that Target customers aren't the .5% of the pop
@Heritage  is supposed to be some sort of "think tank"? Clearly "thinking" is not what you do. Spreading misinformation is.
@Heritage  I will not shot there ever again.....
@Heritage  I'll never shop target
@Heritage  Shame that most Americans don't see the Truth, Republican distraction from their problems from within.
@Heritage  Is this serious?  Is that how Hastert and Sandusky did it?
@bladewormer  @Heritage  Weren't they gay / bi? That's how they got access to their victims.  If hetero pervert no access to girls in shower.

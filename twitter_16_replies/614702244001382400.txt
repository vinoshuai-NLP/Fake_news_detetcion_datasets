@politico  hmm', That must've been a spontaneous decision. Couldnt have been pre-planned since didnt know how #SCOTUS would rule. Yeah right!
@politico  sad sad sad using the capital to be political
@politico  I still don't recognize this ruling. A marriage is between a man and a woman period! Let each state have a say for themselves..
@politico  @RealRonHoward  nice now that is cool ! POTUS et al gettin creative and it is working big time....

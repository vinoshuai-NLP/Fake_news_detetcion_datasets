@Demonze1  @CNNPolitics  @RepMiaLove well said. Colour isn't important nows time to forget what great-grandfathers did. Live in the now
@CNNPolitics  @cnnbrk  @RepMiaLove  ..their plans wasn't going to work out ..I'm still not voting for her
@CNNPolitics  @allanbrauer  @RepMiaLove Too little too late!
@CNNPolitics  @cnnbrk  @RepMiaLove I'm racist so I'd like the US gov to return all my money back that I've "donated" over the years.
@CNNPolitics  @cnnbrk  @RepMiaLove she knew what this guy was about before accepting his money. Her gesture to return it means nothing.
@RepMiaLove What a hypocrite. She's returning the money now as it came to light. Wasn't someone checking donars?  @CNNPolitics  @cnnbrk
@RepMiaLove  @CNNPolitics  @cnnbrk  that should read 'donors'
@CNNPolitics  @cnnbrk  @RepMiaLove Unacceptable. Guess if #CharlestonShooting hadn't happened the supremacist's dollars would have been kept
@htowngenie  @CNNPolitics  @cnnbrk  @RepMiaLove With all due respect, how many ppl contribute to politicians & how much $$ to review them all?
@CNNPolitics  @RepMiaLove already corrupt
Alleged? What's wrong with  @CNNPolitics  ?@RepMiaLove
@CNNPolitics  @RepMiaLove - race is fiction. Applied racism: profit enterprise exploits delusional whites. Explains the donation. Class war.
@CNNPolitics  @RepMiaLove How is she even in the Republican party? And why?
@htowngenie  @CNNPolitics  @cnnbrk  @RepMiaLove True but THAT sort of affliation is NOT easily found unless said contributer is on a watch list
@htowngenie  @CNNPolitics  @cnnbrk  @RepMiaLove But then again ... I don't know those sorts ... except the ones on news reports.
@CNNPolitics  @RepMiaLove first black female gop what ? Was she before condi rice ?
@jrasjr_8  @CNNPolitics  @RepMiaLove Congresswoman.
@CNNPolitics  @cnnbrk  @RepMiaLove Once you go Black, you never come back as they say.
@CNNPolitics  @cnnbrk  @RepMiaLove N-O-T impressed. Would have been, had it N-O-T been accepted in the first place!
@CNNPolitics  @cnnbrk  @RepMiaLove This makes no sense.
@kendoblack1  @bestlemming  @CNNPolitics  @cnnbrk  @RepMiaLove exactly Lee that's the only connection I can make along with Allen west
@CNNPolitics  She was surprised?
@CNNPolitics  @cnnbrk  @RepMiaLove great that she is BUT would she and other have if the terrible event in SC had not took place
@CNNPolitics  @cnnbrk  they donated because she saying everything that they are thinking so keep the money you FAKE
@ursus_marit  @CNNPolitics  @cnnbrk  @RepMiaLove Just like Islam? But Islam is A-OK with the left.
@CNNPolitics  @cnnbrk  @RepMiaLove Wait. You had this evil person's money, and you gave it back to him?
@CNNPolitics  @cnnbrk  @RepMiaLove I'm not understanding how you don't know where donations come from anyway.
@CNNPolitics  @RepMiaLove A black, female republican.., no such thing!
@CNNPolitics  @RepMiaLove Imagine that...
@CNNPolitics  @cnnbrk  @RepMiaLove They should take that money and donate it to the black churches of charleston
@CNN  @CNNPolitics  How come CNN is ignoring the story about white supremacist giving money to GOP candidates.
@CNNPolitics  @cnnbrk  @RepMiaLove It's too late. Well my mom was right. If you lay down with dogs, you get up with fleas.. Shameful.
@ShawdyFresh  @bestlemming   @cnnbrk  @RepMiaLove White Supremacist always looking for a Black face to put out front to make them look legit.
@CNNPolitics  @cnnbrk  @RepMiaLove xbz
@CNNPolitics  @cnnbrk  @RepMiaLove Do you Know who's Giving You $$'s
@CNNPolitics  @RepMiaLove  The whole Republican party feeds off of racism.

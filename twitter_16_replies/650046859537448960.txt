Jakaś zorganizowana akcja chyba... " @nytimes :An openly gay said - he and met with Pope a day before Kim Davis did http://nyti.ms/1QPE7Mi"
@nytimes  and what does that prove or matter?
@nytimes  The big news is that they met in a gay bar.
@nytimes  Whoever thought that meeting was an endorsement is a bit simple'. As if......
@nytimes  It was an old friend of the Pope who happened to be gay. Vatican is trying to spin this as cover over secret meeting w/Kim Davis
@nytimes  is this the Catholic Churches attempt to look neutral  when it comes to gay rights? Cause I'm not buying it...
@nytimes  pretty sure his boss once met with tax collectors and prostitutes.  #WalklikeJesus
@nini_rdz  @nytimes  So do you think he needs man or woman for sex?
@nytimes  You're a trip.
@nytimes  bet kim ain't smilin anymore.
“ @nytimes : An openly gay man and his partner met w/ Pope Francis a day before Kim Davis did http://nyti.ms/1QPE7Mi" that's more like Francis
@nytimes  wait...you mean humans with differing values/views can respectfully communicate and actually listen to each other's stories?! #wow
@nytimes  Show-offs!
@nytimes  what do you want a cookie? Who cares who was first? Did Pope give the gay couple his blessing? and tell em to keep up the fight!
@nini_rdz  @nytimes  I see.
@nytimes   The libiots & their Vatican cell promote Pope's meeting with gay couple.
@nytimes  And there's no way the Pope could bless them and say he's a man of God.

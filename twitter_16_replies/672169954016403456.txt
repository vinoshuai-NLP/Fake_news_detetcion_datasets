@ABC  just shut already Obama u will do nothing about it but talk
@ABC  then enforce that damn laws Mr. President! We dont need new ones that you won't enforce!
@ABC  @6abc  No parallel is right! Americans of all races r disgracing this country! Over stupidest things imaginable!! IT'S A DAMN SHAME!!!
@0Hour1  @ABC  https://youtube.com/watch?v=7OZIOE6aMBkâ€¦
@ABC  @ABC7  and now he takes our guns
@ABC  it's gonna get to a point where future Presidents will just say, "well, this shit happens."
@ABC  @6abc  USA!!! Once a place for dreams n hope!! Let's get back to that Country
@ABC   This looks like a well planned hit.  President jumps to conclusions as normal.
@Maverick_SS_49  I scream at all shooters of any color! Chicago is more of a war zone due to institutionalized racism/poverty.
@ABC  How is that strict gun control California?
@ABC  @6News  California has the most gun strict laws in American?
@ABC  Except that he is president.
@0Hour1  @ABC  link to report of it being jihad attack?
@ABC  @ABC7  Too easy to obtain a gun.
@ABC  yes it does! Media coverage! Remember the "Road Rage" in the 1990s?
@ABC  oh, so guns are the problem. So why are the police called? They have guns. Stay alert here. Good people with guns kill bad people with
@ABC  @6abc  how do we stop the pattern of this awful #evil
@ABC  Psychopaths No only in the real life, but also videogames, movies, etc. How young people can see the real life with all that stuff?!
@ABC  @FCN2go  this administration has made us a 3rd world country. No respect for human life.
@EF517_V2  @pikester45  @POTUS  @ABC  Shocking that the climate change pow wow in Paris didn't rebuke all this!
@ABC  @SurvivorMed   Wonder why it appears only to happen in states with "strict" gun control and has increased significantly since Obama ?
@ABC  FUBO Given the FBI reported that no one died at Sandy Hook in Newtown, CT in 2012, I'm hoping this will turn out to be more BS
@ABC  Maybe if the gun laws were not so strict in California, someone could have protected themselves
@marshallpyke  @ABC  @SurvivorMed  You seem like a very bright American. What a great reflection of our society you are.
. @ABC  @SentinelJason Yet another feckless response.
@ABC  If they find the shooters to be Muslim extremist, will he asked for the removal of all? No gun has ever shot anyone unassisted. #moron
@1Ruhd1  @ABC  Only Ted Cruz is allowed to politicize tragedies, I guess. Is the president supposed to ignore these events?
@ABC  except in Mali, throughout Kenya, Nigeria, could go on...
@ABC  it's all happening under your watch, it's probably what you wanted, so you can get your way a lot easier.
@ABC  But, but...I thought California had strict gun laws! How could this happen! I guess the bad guys forgot about the law. #Caliraq
@ABC  Said the President who released 5 top terrorists in exchange for 1 deserter and left Americans in Iran while support nukes for Iran.
@ABC  What about the mass killings in Oakland, Chicago, Detroit?  Why don't these gang killings get the attention?
@ABC  and we will have more until he gets his way #PotusIsBehindTheseShootings
@ABC  Said the creator of gun running to criminals for murder via Fast N Furious stupidity while attempting to disarm patriots.
@ABC  If journalism wasn't dead, Barack Obama would be slumped up against a wall in crack house where he belongs.
@elise_annaa  @ABC
@elise_annaa  @ABC  HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!! Facts about hand and feets as we face mass shooting after mass shooting? No thanks.

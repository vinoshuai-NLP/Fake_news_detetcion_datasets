@piersmorgan  if you analyze w/ an open mind, not just emotions, what he's saying you would say: "Ok, I can see what he meant by that."
@piersmorgan  Nice article on BC. After his Monday FB post I figured he must have taken the Hypocritical rather than the Hippocratic Oath.
@piersmorgan  as 'brainless' as you may call him, he still got brains than you.
@piersmorgan  it's easier to bash someone from your point of view, than taking into consideration another point of view. Human nature.
@piersmorgan  another column spewing lies and uneducated opinion.
" @piersmorgan : Ben Carson is the most brainless brain surgeon in America. http://dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3263849/PIERS-MORGAN-Ben-Carson-brainless-brain-surgeon-America-hope-gets-bounced-race-s-late.html?ito=social-twitter_dailymailusâ€¦" Have u read this? What's ur take?
@piersmorgan  Would like to know if you have the knowledge to write an article about current BJP regime?
@piersmorgan  You call ganging up to attack a gunman bat**it crazy?? No wonder it took 3 Americans to rescue a train full of Europeans.
@piersmorgan  methinks he is clinically insane. Pedestrian arguments and hollow allusions.
@piersmorgan  @EdreesAbiodun Word!
@piersmorgan  spot on! cannot believe how this moron got this far in the race with this kind of mindset and arrogance!
@piersmorgan  good piece so when are you taking Trump to task for his racist views about Mexicans and immigrants? Looking forward to it Piers
@piersmorgan  Carson's views are inexplicable, it doesn't take a cryptologist to decode that guns kill, let alone a brain surgeon!!!
@piersmorgan  this is arguably the most brilliant article ever. We could've been proud of Dr. Carson for eternity but now he shames us.
@piersmorgan  you're probably right about Carson, butthecomparisons to your cousin are needlessYou don't know Him personally, much is assumed
@piersmorgan  I admire your honesty in your articles.
@piersmorgan  Why are we surprised that people like him still exist who sell their soul and conscience?
@piersmorgan  When Piers attack you, I bet you would prefer a lion attack. Ben Carson obliterated and chuck in the bin.
@piersmorgan  Thank God someone's noticed.Clearly something wrong w him. He's not fit to be president. Google his quotes. Outlandish comments
@piersmorgan  I'm going to be politically correct and label u racist. I have to !!
@piersmorgan  this doctor is the type that will ALWAYS use people worst experiences to be on top...how insensitive can one be
@piersmorgan  there aren't many people in media who could speak their mind with all honesty and without being worried about others' opinion.
@piersmorgan  @JoeofYeezus   @CggCesar
@piersmorgan  @10Cgg
@piersmorgan  @10Cgg  leelo putita o tienes miedo
@piersmorgan  maybe he should just be a doctor, its americans that can shame him
@piersmorgan   So whose opinion should I trust?  A brilliant surgeon or cell phone hacking publicity hound from another country. That's tough
@piersmorgan  Piers, he speaks endlessly about God. He's too dispassionate. Read his other quotes. Frightening. Maybe just an idiot savant?
@piersmorgan  Appreciate that this was aimed at a US audience, but as this is the UK version it would be nice if you corrected the spelling?
@ArsenaIDan  @piersmorgan   You's ain't getting neither ha!
@piersmorgan  every wonder how things would have ended if these men would have accepted the attackers terms?
@piersmorgan  Ben Carson is so desperate to please the conservative core of his party hence his daft comments on Guns and abortion.
@piersmorgan  haven you learned your lesson?  You don't get an opinion here
@piersmorgan  and you are full of $#!t.
@piersmorgan  is this true

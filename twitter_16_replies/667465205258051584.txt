@carolinagirl63  @anne_norton  same here I thought he was born here

@carolinagirl63  @Marine0141  https://twitter.com/carolinagirl63/status/667465205258051584… hello  @POTUS  & the rest of the libtards it is happening here
@carolinagirl63  Seriously? It takes 2 seconds to Google him and find he was an American Citizen and a MIGRANT from Jordan. Not a refugee.
@carolinagirl63  Though I won't deny that he's a piece of shit radical that should never have had the chance to do what he did.
@carolinagirl63  @Joey_Hana I believe he was born in USA
@Joey_Hana  @carolinagirl63   Thanks, I do remember something about Jordan, yehhh his dad was in Kuwait, I can't keep track of 'em all.

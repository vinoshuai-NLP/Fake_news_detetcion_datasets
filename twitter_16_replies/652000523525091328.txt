@Telegraph  Ye, because there hypocrites. I know a say so "veggie" who eats chicken every know and again.
@Telegraph  @Hardyduncan  The craving for fatty foods is tough. I wonder if it's same for people who are veggie from birth?
@Telegraph  @RobTwitmore  @LaurenCaulfield  I'm sure this happens....
@Telegraph  Not to mention vegetarian teetotallers.

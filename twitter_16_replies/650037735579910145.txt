@nytvideo  @nytimes  Davis pursues her gravy train and wishes to ride Pope's coat tails at popular visit. Remember fake photo?
@nytvideo  @nytimes  Davis claimed images was rally supporting her cause. It was not. No integrity.
@nytvideo  @nytimes  She just happened to show up while 330M wernt invited
@nytvideo  @nytimes  the Pope should declare that, not anyone else please,  don't speculate
@nytvideo  @nytimes  I call bullshit.
@nytvideo  @nytimes  Big Poppa Poppin US
@nytvideo  Eu não caio na graça desse papa Francisco...acredito eu que ele não seja o que diz ser.
O dialogo não quer dizer aprovação, mas tolerancia e busca de novos rumos.  @nytvideo  @nytimes
@nytvideo  @nytimes  The Pope approves gay marriages ??
Um Lider Religioso precisa receber a todos com afabilidade. Mas não quer dizeer 100% concordancia com tudo e todos.  @nytvideo  @nytimes
@nytvideo  @nytimes  Maybe it was to read her her "Last Rights"
@nytimes  @nytvideo   so, now..even the Vicar of Christ is capable of Lies!  http://americablog.com/2015/09/pope-francis-government-workers-have-a-right-to-to-refuse-same-sex-marriages.html…
@nytimes  @nytvideo   Christ was killed for his honesty! Apparently, the current Pope is more interested in his own popularity!
@nytimes  @nytvideo   then what the Hell is this? http://americablog.com/2015/09/pope-francis-government-workers-have-a-right-to-to-refuse-same-sex-marriages.html…
@nytvideo  @nytimes  / the nyslimes. Cant wait when you go out business.
Can't believe media et al is boxing a Pope into a corner like this!  @nytvideo  @nytimes
@nytvideo  then condemn her and her intolerance for God's children. Gay or not isn't it the Christians duty to be kind, even to "sinners'?
@nytvideo  @nytimes  not what she heard
@nytvideo  @nytimes  The Pope just lost my vote!
@nytvideo  @nytimes    It smells like shit. It looks like shit ... but it is cheese?
@nytvideo  @nytimes  now we are #FlipFlopping #KimDavis any comments
@nytvideo  Did Pop hear about Nuba Mountains People's problems then why he keep silent
@nytvideo  @nytimes  why didn't this come out sooner while he was here. He had no business visiting with her.
@nytvideo  @nytimes  whether you agree with Kim Davis or not, this has to be a big "OOPS" moment for the Pope. #Busted
@nytvideo  @nytimes  sure seemed like it!! I was very disappointed, thought everyone was created equal!! 
@nytvideo  @nytimes  come on, read between the lines! He went because he had free time??? Actions speak louder than words.
@nytvideo  @nytimes  So then the Pope is on board with gay marriage?
@nytvideo  @nytimes  yeah she is trying to make us think the Pope is supporting her choice

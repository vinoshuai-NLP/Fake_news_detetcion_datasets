@Lindabillion Then you're just ignorant, dumb, and stupid if you don't understand the value of this information.
@HuffingtonPost  I would have expected him to choose Chick-Fil-A. #AbundanceofIntolerance
@HuffingtonPost  How sweet. That was really nice of them! See instead of shooting an Armed kid, they treet him to Burgers! Oh white kid in NC
@HuffingtonPost  if he was a black killer we would've rioted an burned down our neighborhood
@HuffingtonPost  The line at McDonalds was much to long.
@HuffingtonPost  O thats no surprise,he is going to get many perks from alot of "Closet Klansmen"all the way to trial
@HuffingtonPost  why not. It is a human beeing, as we all are. Even the evil has the right to live.
@HuffingtonPost  Baiting him to get answers   .........
@HuffingtonPost  Another perk for him he doesn't have to deal with black cops ,primarily handled by white cops#AMERICAN LOVE
@HuffingtonPost  Why not BUGER KING,HE BEEN HAVIN IT HIS WAY SINCE THE FIRST BULLET WAS FIRED ,SO IT'S APPROPRIATE
@HuffingtonPost  this story is such a spectacle. Look at from outside of the blatant issues and read it like a fiction... Dark humor
@HuffingtonPost  You think #freddie gray got any Burger King? Ridiculous.
@HuffingtonPost  Well killing 9 niggers takes a lot of energy. *sarcasm off*
My black ass would have starved RT  @HuffingtonPost  Cops bought the alleged church shooter Burger King hours after killings
@HuffingtonPost  He was brought a burger at the police station  bcz w/holding food could have caused his confession to be overturned.
@HuffingtonPost  Yet another case of police brutality!
@HuffingtonPost  I bet if he was Black they would given him a bologni sandwich if that. 
@HuffingtonPost  #Charleston shooter. Police had to feed the creep he had not even been charged yet.   Let's go after the police again?

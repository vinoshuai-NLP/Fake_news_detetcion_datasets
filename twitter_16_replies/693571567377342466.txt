@ABC  Pretty over the top I'd say. Americans w/never allow for gov to move in that direction.Last 7 years been bad enough w/setbacks/division
@ABC  Stop with the propaganda!
@ABC  What would make her say that? He looks normal.
@ABC   Hitler, that's a bit of a stretch, more like a used car salesman talking nothing but shit
@ABC  Nobody willing to talk about Students from Trump University suing him.. Why the secret...????
@ABC  Not a fan  @realDonaldTrump  but stop with all the Hitler references as that's just stupid.
@bohratom  @ABC  @realDonaldTrump  I hope &pray he makes your life &our children's lives/future reach FULL Potential.Thanks 4 the kind words

@ABC  @abc7newsBayArea  what a stupid comment
@ABC  esbuna shame that compare with Hitler Donald Trump, a candidate discredit our country in this way
@ABC  Her time and pseudo celebrity would be better served if she actively worked to promote harmony. Comparing Trump to Hitler is hyperbole.
@ABC  @StudyingLiberty  Anne Franks stepsister is anti-Israel

@ABC  I agree
@ABC  He doesn't advocate death!
@ABC  all the Network are interviewing Anti - Trump analysts political commentators and any and every one they can find against Trump

@ABC   Totally agree.
@ABC  Similarities btn Nazis & Am'n far right - racists, emphasize military & security & intolerant. Hitler tried 2 make Germany great again
@ABC  that seems a bit disrespectful to holocaust victims as it lightens what they went through
@ABC  Plus, how old is she and how has the trauma she endured affected her cognition? This is not a news story
@ABC  German's bought into Hitlers arguments 2 make Germany great again after loss in WWI.Then Jews were problem taking jobs etc. Now Muslims
@ABC  So true! Been feeling the same for a while myself. Only Americans don't want to admit the similitude
@ABC  And then there's this. #WakeUpAmerica
@ABC  The truth hurts but it helps.
@ABC  That's what everyone is saying

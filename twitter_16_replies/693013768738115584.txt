@BBCBreaking  Is Decision uphold in Court.
@BBCBreaking  But what's the point of civil partnerships now? They were an inadequate half measure which has been subsequently corrected.
@BBCBreaking   @BBCNews  boo fucking hoo
@BBCBreaking  In a country that allegedly strives for equal rights for all, this is just bonkers!
@AllAdzUp  govt has made such a mess of this legislation. They should have built into the same Sex marriage bill a slow phase out of civil pt
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  most discriminated against people in Britain?  White, Heterosexual tax paying, law abiding, car drivers!
@bbcbreaking  just ridiculous
@Baulked1  @TurbulentStoker  @BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  it's still not equal is it we have civil partnerships you can marry in church unrestricted
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  There's nothing like a bit of equality.....
@BBCBreaking  move to the Netherlands. Me and my girlfriend are civil partners, not married. No problem at all.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  makes no sense...it's marriage in another name! Pointless..
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  - ?? It's called a 'domestic partnership' & heteros can have them here. UK is f'd up- join the 21st century, cave folk
@BBCBreaking  @VictoriaLIVE  - Don't see how they felt discriminated against either. Strange.
@TequilaPixie  @BBCBreaking  @VictoriaLIVE  equally hard to know why they should be.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  time wasters - civil partnership should now be converted to marriage and we should all move on
@simonsaysyow  @BBCBreaking  - skewed notions of!
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  That's unfortunate. I do believe in civil unions no matter one's orientation
@BBCBreaking  Equality is fine, as long as those making the rules agree with it!
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  I bet they're a right pair of miseries.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Ridiculous. Gender should not enter into it.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  stupid laws, once again bowing to the gays give them all the choice but overall majority of the population cant
@BBCBreaking  if they are that comitted to each other get fucking married...couple wallies really
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  now that all sexes can marry religious or non surely the cival partnership brought in for gays can now we phased out
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  a clearer case of sexual discrimination would be hard to find. Make CP's open to all or scrap completely.
@Dru_Anu  @BBCBreaking  They already have equal rights, get married in a registry office if they dont want a ceremony. Something gays cant do.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  That's discriminatory
@BBCBreaking  life used to be so less complicated.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  some people need to grow up and stop causing trouble for the sake of it. Their argument is ridiculous.
@BBCBreaking  now that marriage equality is a thing, they should just scrap civil partnerships. You want to get married? Get married. Simple
@TojoHunter  @BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  not what we want at all just to be treated fairly and in equal terms.
@TojoHunter  @UptonLucy  @BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  and trolls resort to abuse when they have no sensible argument
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  only minorities win
@BBCBreaking  It's official, homosexuality is now compulsory, whether you like it or not.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCLondonNews  @BBCNews I sincerely hope they paid their own legal fees, what a waste of time & money!
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  oh yes I forgot about the troubles and discrimination of the straight, white community. The pair need to get a grip.
@BBCBreaking  Unbelievable, so much for equality.
@getinthesea  Seen these guys? “ @BBCBreaking : UK heterosexual couple who want to enter civil partnership rather http://bbc.in/1QK4fez”
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  case of reverse bias?

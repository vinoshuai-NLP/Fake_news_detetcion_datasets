@BBCBreaking  We would kill for that kind of growth in the west.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCWorld  @BBCNews  it grew 7%. when did the UK-economy (or EU-economy for that matter) grow 7% for the last time???
@maamikron42  @BBCBreaking  @BBCWorld  @BBCNews  since the GDP per capita in China is not outstanding, UK is still stronger economically.
@BBCBreaking  6%  growth for a big economy like China is enormous.

@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  it's still about 7% which is pretty good
@BBCBreaking  This is Awesome!

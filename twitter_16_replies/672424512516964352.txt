@tpb_50cal  @IngrahamAngle  @JohnRLottJr  @POTUS  AND...U can keep ur Doctor, too
@IngrahamAngle  @JohnRLottJr  Those weren't pipe bombs!!! They were a science project!
@IngrahamAngle  @JohnRLottJr  and how many in America were gang related? Bet a majority. But again Libs do nothing about gang violence/crime.
@IngrahamAngle  @JohnRLottJr  I was lking at the stats any the 1 I saw had every country with more ms shootings per cap had stricter gun regs
@IngrahamAngle  @JohnRLottJr  Bullshit. Rampage victims in america vs. Overall homicides in a terrorized city? Try comparing apples to apples.
@IngrahamAngle  @JohnRLottJr  ENEMY IN THE WH
@IngrahamAngle  @JohnRLottJr  Oh but it is climate change and guns he will say.
@Alex_P_Johnson  @IngrahamAngle  @Writeonright  @JohnRLottJr  Well, if you'd rather compare Paris to the entire US than be wrong, then yes!
@Alex_P_Johnson  @IngrahamAngle  @Writeonright  @JohnRLottJr  I've long since accepted that lefties are pathologically incapable of being wrong.
@nvrgvupnvr  @IngrahamAngle  @JohnRLottJr  In my almost 70 years on this earth, I've NEVER seen us THIS divided. The Obamunists caused this
@IngrahamAngle  @JohnRLottJr  let's just build a wall around California, Illinois, and DC and see who comes out on top in a year.
@IngrahamAngle  @JohnRLottJr  Dem weasel words-”Gun Violence”. Criminal Violence–Yes, Islamic Terror–Yes. Dems can’t call anything what it is.
@IngrahamAngle  @tomh2739  @JohnRLottJr   But America is the only place to have gun violence. Right? However could that be  @POTUS
@IngrahamAngle  @JohnRLottJr   Last sentence.  Thought for the day.
@IngrahamAngle  @JohnRLottJr    Ohhh but haven't you heard Laura?, these things only happen in the USA, according to the Huckster-in-Chief.
@IngrahamAngle  @JohnRLottJr  impeach Obama! I know it won't happen. That would certainly fix a lot of our problems!
@IngrahamAngle  @JohnRLottJr  If the female has been here on a K1 visa since 2014, doesn't that make her illegal?
@IngrahamAngle  @JohnRLottJr  #SanBernardino Bernardino terrorist attack may have been staged by corrupt gov advancing gun control agenda!
@IngrahamAngle  @JohnRLottJr  So we shouldn't be more like EU?
@IngrahamAngle  @JohnRLottJr  obamas clueless! !  Get em OUT !
@IngrahamAngle  @JohnRLottJr  Wow... Great achievement for Obama.
@IngrahamAngle  @JohnRLottJr  Tracks ack to #Obama's '#ArabSpring!'
@IngrahamAngle  How many people have been killed by illegal aliens since Obama took office?
@IngrahamAngle  @songbirdcd  @JohnRLottJr  thanks for sharing.
@IngrahamAngle  @JohnRLottJr  @FighterNtheKid  @BrendanSchaub  Very very telling.
@IngrahamAngle  @JohnRLottJr   where do you have the data on mass shootings in Paris from? Do you add vounded and killed in Paris?
. @WaiGuoGuizi  @AdsTim  @IngrahamAngle  FRA had more casualties (murders&inj) from MPS in '15 than US had during O pres http://crimeresearch.org/2015/12/france-suffered-more-casualties-murders-and-injuries-from-mass-public-shootings-in-2015-than-the-us-has-suffered-during-obamas-entire-presidency-508-to-424-2/…
@WaiGuoGuizi  @IngrahamAngle  @JohnRLottJr  FBI?
@WaiGuoGuizi  @AdsTim  @IngrahamAngle   No,CPRC # for Mass Public Shootings,oth vast majority have no one killed,gang fights,not public,not FBI
@WaiGuoGuizi  @AdsTim  @IngrahamAngle  This is the FBI definition of Mass Public Shootings - public place,4 or more killed,not drug gang,etc
@WaiGuoGuizi  @AdsTim  @IngrahamAngle  Not true, plus France is way worse if you adjust for the fact that their country is 1//5th size of US

@Gawker  @GreatDismal  You know nothing Nikki Haley.
@Gawker  @RealSamMartin  @nikkihaley  She is just the TBagger Of The Month. One in a long line of people who go #Durp.
@Gawker  @txvoodoo  She's a twit. *live tweeted from inside South Carolina* *help me*
@JanLNye  Hey, I'm in Tx. We have to help ourselves.
@Gawker  @Barbie892  Gov. H is a dolt of the highest order,  . #StopGOP 
@nikkihaley  speaks on behalf of the #GOP who wants to #TakeOurCountryBack to that very time.  #clueless  @Gawker  @wbruce44
@Gawker  lol. I guess she isn't a student of history. The GOP needs  @CondoleezzaRice  to run as their vp candidate.
@Gawker  @ReaganGomez  WHY DO THEY KEEP GIVING HER CREDIT FOR REMOVING THE FLAG? SHE WAS FORCED TO !
@Gawker  Ok NIMRATTA HALEY
@Gawker  @KatieMargareta  she's the Indian Sarah Palin.
@Gawker  @GreatDismal  @nikkihaley  R stands for racist. GOP is racist.  Time to stand behind your words Nikki and denounce your party.
@Gawker  Ideological stupidity is the worst kind.
@Gawker  @nkjemisin  that's...what the? How...I keep thinking I can respond, but then just What?! is all I can do. Stunning.
@Gawker  @nikkihaley  What do your parents, siblings say about your comments?

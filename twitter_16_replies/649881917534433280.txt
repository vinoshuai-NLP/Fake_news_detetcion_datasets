@nytimes  That is really good news.  @snolen
@serbretas  it's rubbish. how cld it be seen as anything other than endorsement? Suggests Vatican didn't appreciate how far they overstepped
@_WASTON_ bigot huh?
@nytimes  Sure, they just wanted to meet pure evil bigotry.
“ @nytimes : Pope Francis’ Meeting Wasn’t an Endorsement of Kim Davis, Vatican Says http://nyti.ms/1JJbawj” too late

@NBCNightlyNews  @MSNBC  whatttt??? He has gone completely off the deep end .
@KaylaBradstreet  @NBCNightlyNews  @MSNBC  @realDonaldTrump  if dads have 50%, then men should have 50% of choice if woman can abort or not.
@NBCNightlyNews  @MSNBC  No one does more damage to  @realDonaldTrump   than he does.Is it hard to talk with your foot in your mouth? #dumptrump
@Charlie_Ricker  @NBCNightlyNews  @MSNBC  I was going to say something like that but I'm so politically correct I couldn't do it lol.
@NBCNightlyNews  @MSNBC  WOW!!!!!!!!!!Hey Ladies!!!!!!! GOP Frontrunner!!!!!!!! Wow!!!!!!!!!!
@NBCNightlyNews  @MSNBC  Does he want them in prison? If so, are building new prisons for women part of a job package?
@NBCNightlyNews  I think the things the GOP openly says about women's reproductive rights is punishment enough.
@NBCNightlyNews  @MSNBC  punishment for something that's legal.
@NBCNightlyNews  @MSNBC  that quote was 'if abortion was to be outlawed'.not agreeing or disagreeing, but you have to put the quote in context
@ChrisHiuser  @NBCNightlyNews  @MSNBC  Even so, it's STUPID!
@NBCNightlyNews  @MSNBC  Maybe there should be some kind of punishment for stupid men.
@NBCNightlyNews  @MSNBC  really trying his hardest to win 0% of the female vote come November
@NBCNightlyNews  @MSNBC  dont support his statement either way but he said illegal abortions
@ASEDawg89  @NBCNightlyNews  @MSNBC  Trump supports banning abortions that means most abortions will be illegal.
@NBCNightlyNews  @MSNBC   WHAT A jackass.  @realDonaldTrump
@NBCNightlyNews  oh ok, why not skip running for president & make it Supreme Emperor of the World  @realDonaldTrump .  Please people wake up!
@NBCNightlyNews  @goldietaylor  @MSNBC  I am so tired of old men trying intrude on a women's right to choose. This from the party of guns.
@_SC0RN3D__V1X3N  @NBCNightlyNews  @MSNBC   Exactly!
@NBCNightlyNews  @MSNBC  I'm pro life -- I think this shit is crazy! I thinks he's crazy and anyone who supports him needs to be committed!!
@NBCNightlyNews  @goldietaylor  @MSNBC  I really don't think he wants to be POTUS.
@NBCNightlyNews  @MSNBC  Wow.
@NBCNightlyNews  @MSNBC  Is there any way you could try any harder to lose the women's vote?
@NBCNightlyNews  @MSNBC  @realDonaldTrump  and his tiny hands needs to be disqualified. I'm disgusted with the people voting for him
@NBCNightlyNews  @MSNBC
Lol WHAT RT  @NBCNightlyNews : JUST IN: Donald Trump to  @MSNBC : "There has to be some form of punishment" for women who have an abortion.
@NBCNightlyNews  @MSNBC  Trump, who is afraid of a female reporter with a pen, wants to punish women for abortions. Crazy!
@NBCNightlyNews  @MSNBC  @realDonaldTrump  JUST....
@NBCNightlyNews  @MSNBC  this is horrific, but Trump isn't alone in this thinking. GOP officials around the country are trying to defund PP.
@NBCNightlyNews  @ljam185  @MSNBC  this flashback to a 1920 article ......oh wait....
@NBCNightlyNews  you have to be kidding
@NBCNightlyNews  @MSNBC  this brings me to tears. nowhere to even go with this trash.
@NBCNightlyNews  @MSNBC  I think that Trump really doesn't want to president, he just got himself backed into the corner after declaring
@NBCNightlyNews  @MSNBC  build a wall around the uterus

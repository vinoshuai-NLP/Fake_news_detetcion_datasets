@itsmepanda1  Well said!  @cnnbrk  http://thefullertoninformer.com/the-war-on-fertility-via-the-forced-vaccination-agenda-enter-the-zika-virus/…
@cnnbrk  Zika is spread by the Aedes (a tropical) mosquito. Why is this point not raised? Have a look at Aedes distribution!
@cnnbrk  so what's worse...a virus that might cause a baby with 2 heads.....or the vaccine to kill it that will give your child autism...hmmm
@cnnbrk  it's impressive how serious this is becoming. This will be the disease of the century.
@cnnbrk  very, odd, all the smart folks and technology yet this just sneaks up, really, media treat people so stupid. More like ignored
@cnnbrk  what do you think is going to happen with large numbers of people moving around diseases will rise. Do we not have CDC, TRACKINGTHIS
@cnnbrk  quit letting people in this country you're going to destroy this country doing that
@cnnbrk  there's diseases coming in this country because y'all won't stop people from coming in really protecting America in ain't you
@cnnbrk  yeshostory does have a way of repeating itself
@cnnbrk  was this virus not identified in the past? What is the main cause of the outbreak? Strange..

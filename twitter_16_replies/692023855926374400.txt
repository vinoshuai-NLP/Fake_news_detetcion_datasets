@AdrianaBustosV  ya seeeee puro loco!!!
@cnnbrk  another "Gun Free Zone" no doubt. All military personnel should be armed and this would not have been a target rich environment.
@cnnbrk  "or fight"? Why would they say that, do they want more people shot?
@IdiotNews4U  @cnnbrk  It's a military hospital, so hopefully they are calling for trained active duty military members who are on site.

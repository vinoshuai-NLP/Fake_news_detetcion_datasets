@ABC  lmfao guess ppl really don't understand #capitalism
@ABC  i don't see how he could be mad & sue,i understand his company logo is on the truck but still he gave up ownership
@ABC  charge everyone with treason who's had anything to do with this. #Know who you do business with
@ABC  Maybe he should have thought about removing the logo before trading it in? He might have received more on his trade in as well.
@ABC  lesson to be learned..I destroy old license plates.nothing goes anywhere with my name numbers.haunt.poor guy..no case..not in writing..
@ABC  & he should because that should have been removed before going to auction .
@ABC  There's a typical Am'n businessman. Selling trucks to enemy. US govn't is responsible for ISIS having hundreds of trucks #usapoli #tcot
@ABC  Why did he leave his name on it?

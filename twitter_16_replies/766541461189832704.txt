@BBCNews  This just happened in Vegas two days ago, child did not survive a pit bull attacked him 
@BBCNews  shame some people don't have the same views for pedos rapists murderers and child killers....
any moron can own a dog, they have no idea what in the doggy world, is actually attack behaviour....1/2
instead you hear"he just wants to play" NO! Jumping up strangers is being aggressive to the dog, who just wants to fight 2/2
on the contrary a dog jumping up is a friendly action.
@BBCNews  I wonder what dog it is? Surprise surprise!
People need to be held responsible for their pets.
@BBCNews  terrible news. If it was a dog breed the mainstream media label as 'dangerous', they'd have named the breed instantly.
@BBCNews  tragic loss again, people need to not bring dogs up to be aggressive, when will they learn
@BBCNews  put her and dog down see how fast this is stored not the answer for the litter boy or famaly RIP  train both or sleep
what about the stabbing in Strasbourg.
@BBCNews  dogligon of peace at it again????
why? A Labrador with shit owners is as likely to bite as any breed. Blame the owners.
@BBCNews  Dog must be put down - cannot rely on it !
@BBCNews  会玩
@BBCNews  heartbreaking
@BBCNews  awful! So sorry for the family
A dog is a dog...
@BBCNews  tragedy..
@BBCNews   May his soul rest in perfect peace.☆
@BBCNews  Give same attention to kids in aleppo...the little boy pulled from the rubbles in Syria
that's why i stop my kids getting close to dogs which aren't leashed.the owners might get no punishment in China,just pay sth.
@BBCNews  Sad man. Breaks my heart.
@BBCNews  dreadful news.
lol wth 
That's damn scary. We were lucky to escape the other day 
@bowland29  @BBCBreaking  @BBCNewsAus
Exactly unlike that lady who had no common sense whatsoever.
Oh yes please do, she needs to be told man. Been twice now and she still hasn't changed
Yeah I just came home now. So knackered. Oh yes! Staying over yeah?
"her laughing will be enough" 
come quicklyyy
lol ikr
LOOOOOL the ending killed me 
Awwwh persuade her to come please. I need to hear her laughter lol
Awwwh bless you
Apumoni's waiting for you now!!!
Tell me about it.
@BBCNews  Jesus this is no 2 death by dog bite. As it doesn't mention the dog being put down I assume it's still alive? #wtf
To own certain breeds it would be better to have to apply for a license and have an interview. Genuine, responsible people only!
Perfect! Thats all what Im talking about. So many people want certain breeds for the wrong reasons and we end up with dangerous dogs

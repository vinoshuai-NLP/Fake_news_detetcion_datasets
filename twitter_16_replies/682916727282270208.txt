Typical #ISIS mentality: #Erdogan is so confident about the ignorance of his party's voter base.  @guardiannews  #Turkey #IslamicMafia
#Erdogan and his ruling neoislamic party are the greatest success of #CIA in recent history: Destroy secular democracies in ME  @guardiannews
@guardiannews  sweet Jesus! And to think the fools in Brussels are engaging with that deranged thug to facilitate EU entry!

@RJThurston91  @guardiannews  I may be dead wrong, but maybe is to appeal to casual facists who don´t khow too much, i saw people here+
@RJThurston91  @guardiannews  + i saw people here in television, saying Hitler was leader of the comunism, because i think their public don´t+
@RJThurston91  @guardiannews  + khow who Stalin was, if i am remebering correctly
@RJThurston91  @guardiannews  i made a mistake, the guy compared a presidency candidate to Hitler, and she is from a Jewish family.
@guardiannews  Haha It's like one of those banal sixth form essays that you would get about Hitler's sound economic policies.
Current #Erdogan-JDP gov is a successful blend of Khomeini, Al Capone, #Hitler, Suharto and #ISIS regimes; congrats to #CIA.  @guardiannews
@guardiannews  #Turkey , the start of a new #Ottoman Empire with the help of the #US, #EU , Dangerous game

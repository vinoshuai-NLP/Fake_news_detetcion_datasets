@ShortyPam  Quite a dude, isn’t he. Sick man.
@ShortyPam  Truth. There are plenty of these sickos hiding under cover of civil society the world over, all ‘cos processes are compromised.
@Joyce_Karam  @lucidite_92  Les #Australiens sont coupables : ils auraient dû expulser le preneur d'otage en #Iran depuis longtemps !
@Joyce_Karam  Yeah , I read about this joker this morning - alleged murder and sex assaults allegations really had my eyebrow raised !
@Joyce_Karam  @eottolenghi  Apparently he was out on bail! Some judge has questions to answer.
@Joyce_Karam  @HalaGorani  in simple word a Mentle
@Joyce_Karam  @LibyaLiberty  Why was this mad man not behind bars? Ugh
@Joyce_Karam  @blackrepublican  46 sex assaults, murdered wife AND STILL WALKING AROUND!!!  Unbelievable..talk about a war on women....
@Joyce_Karam  @blackrepublican  BASTARD whined he was "tortured" in prison. Didn't have to jump 2 his death, burn to death or was beheaded
@Joyce_Karam  @AmirModabbernia He shld have stayed in Iran. With that dossier, he could hve gone places working for Iran's security apparatus
@Joyce_Karam  @INSHAFRUL  Thanikara psycho scene ekak ne.
@Joyce_Karam  @PWilliamsD  murder suspect? 46 sexual assaults? He shouldn't have been walking the streets.

@WalshFreedom  @I_the_Prattler  Canada boycotted them right of the country. Last year.
@WalshFreedom  I'm w/ ya.I dont understand why a handful of sick people expect the whole world to change for them.
@WalshFreedom  well, peeing is normal
@WalshFreedom  Totally agree!!!
@WalshFreedom  I sent them this pic yesterday. I haven't shopped at Walmart in years.
@WalshFreedom  no one pees beside a female. It's all private stalls. Men have taken daughters into male restrooms, how is that any different
@WalshFreedom  @CIndyStarbuck   Targets sales are also dropping.  They may as well file for Bankruptcy.
@WalshFreedom  best news I've heard all day!!
@WalshFreedom  @CaliBlondeLady  @DailyCaller  They opened the door for pedophiles and potential rapists.

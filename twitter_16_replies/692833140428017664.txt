@espn  who's making it black vs. white? First I'm hearing it...
@espn  Than just go out there and play, the less the talking occurs the better
@espn  Cam just beat everybody to it because that was gonna be the issue regardless. Haters don't like an outspoken flamboyant Black QB.
@espn  Can we hold off on the greatness praise until he has a few more great seasons?
@espn  2nd that but the media is in love with division right now
@espn  cam newton is the one promoting the issue.
@espn  Good luck with that Chuck!
@espn  Now please inform your on-air talent to halt any race talk for the next 2 weeks. TIA
@espn  let's just not talk about him at all. Wait until he wins a ring BEFORE you talk about his "greatness".
@espn  people turn to lean with the traditional house hole names. It was never a black and white QB when it came to  @russell  &  @payton
@t0eknife  @espn  #TabloidSportsNetwork use that for now on
@espn  I'm just talking about the LOGOS. A White Bronco versus a Black Panther. Not even talking about the QBs.
@espn  why dont we start with yourself mr barkley.
@espn  wait, he's a QB?
@espn  I agree Charles!!
@espn   bad attitude for the praise he's getting from the black community
@espn  The thought hadn't even crossed my mind until Chuck said something about it.
@espn  they want a "choir boy" like Russell Wilson, or Psycho Tom Brady, Gronk being Gronk, or Aaron Rodgers' Discount Doublecheck.
@t0eknife  @espn  We also don't need to talk about the NFL being 70% Black....this is such a joke
@espn  HE made it about race. Nobody else cares
@espn  thank you but may Charles needs to have a word w superman cause he's the one talking the black shid.
@espn  I will never understand why the "lame stream" media always has to make it racial or sexual! WHO FUCKING CARES! 2 great qbs! That's it!
@espn  Manning says...
@espn  I'm so tired of hearing about a "black QB". Carolina has an amazing QB. MVP I think. Color has no place in this world!!
@espn  who cares #thugs #pretenders
@espn  Heard nothing about race until ESPN brings it up. #SuperBowl
@espn  hear, hear.
@espn  not the first black QB,not the first black QB to play in a Super Bowl, a non story!
@espn  nobody was talking about a "black qb" until you guys brought it up...
@espn  I heard Sir Charles on  @dpshow  and that's all he talked about. Very very few care. But the media sure does. Sir Charles you are media
@espn  thank you  @CharlesBarkIey  racism will disappear if we all stop bringing it up. I think Morgan Freeman had a few things to say about it
@espn ... Totally agree... #IllNeverBeTooOldTo.... #SuperBowl50
@espn  and who started the 'black qb' talk?  The media, who forget the fact that both Doug Williams and Russel Wilson were black & in #SB
@espn  not great yet
@espn  who is talking about a "black qb" all I hear anyone call him is Cam.... Who is doing this ?
@espn !!! Barkley, U the one bringin it up!!!!!!! He's a great QB PERIOD!!!!!! GEEZUS. Sick and tired of media guys tryin to make it black QB
@espn  stick to hating on the Warriors, stay out of football
@espn  the only ones making this an issue is ESPN

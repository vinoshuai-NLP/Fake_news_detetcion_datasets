Awful sad story. I've noticed more uniformed cops at Chipoltle and Subway for this reason: can watch food prep start-to-finish.
@rescuetracker81 the name of this restaurant should be released!! Shamefull! #backtheblue
hope they give them all the law will bear !
What is WRONG with people?   Our police officers deserve our highest regard. That's assault, IMHO. These things make BLM look bad!
Some people are despicable!
On purpose? If so, this has got to stop right now.

black lives matter is a terrorist organization instigating black to become maniacs out to kill.

Broken windows policing? RT  @AP : Ohio police say officer served a sandwich containing glass shards at a restaurant. http://apne.ws/29RuTpq
#TooSoon   @AP

all the idiots blaming Democrats need to expatriate and leave. This is an issue of morals, not political affiliations.
how can Columbus Ohio police put the public in danger by withholding the name ofthe restaurant who assaulted a police officer with glass
it was an act of terrorism against the police once again the employee that purposely put the glass in the sandwich should be arrested
Disgusting!!!!!

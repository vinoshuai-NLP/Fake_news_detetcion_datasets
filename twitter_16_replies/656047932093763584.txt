@cnnbrk  Hillary, tell the committee Bengazi would not have happened if the republicans didn't cut funding/sequester/austerity
@cnnbrk  #istandwithahmed at White House today, CNN will you be there?
@cnnbrk  Time Warner corporate line
@cnnbrk  If Hillary is responsible for Bengazi, then Bush is responsible for 911. But no one blames or questions him
@cnnbrk  your info on who won the debate is bad. You should feel bad.
@cnnbrk  Mr. Sanders seems got to the right problem but was heading to a wrong direction. Lol
@cnnbrk  Because she didn't actually win, CNN!!! What don't you get about that!
@cnnbrk  your own poll had sanders with 81% for the debate win, are you delusional CNN? Hillary did not win
@cnnbrk  stop fucking lying. Sanders won and since Time Warner owns you and they back Hillary you want her to win.
@cnnbrk  @HillaryClinton  You really want Clinton to be President because she's a woman. There must be more than that.

@cnnbrk  might be because Bernie actually won the debate
@cnnbrk  first point is still bullshit no matter how much you state it
@cnnbrk  but Bernie won the debate
@cnnbrk
@cnnbrk  CNN is on of Hilary's major contributors.  Of course you say she won. Your own polls tell a different story.
@cnnbrk  These people just try and see who can piss on the Constitution more then other. Look where it got Obama. Sad for America
@cnnbrk  What the hell are you talking about?!  @BernieSanders  won idiots!
@cnnbrk  you know we've seen YOUR poll results right? It wasn't even close,  @BernieSanders  won by a WIDE margin. Stop misleading people
@cnnbrk  Sanders increased support. Prob cause playing race card with words I'll never forget from a Pres candidate, only #BlackLivesMatter

@fxnleisure  @FoxNews  Oh NO!!  @daveitferris  @harkinHQ
@fxnleisure  ... In other news, 1/3 of drunks eat vegetarians...
@fxnleisure  @FoxNews   or when nobody is looking
@fxnleisure  @FoxNews  she got something in her mouth
@fxnleisure  @FoxNews  I want to know what the other 2/3rds eat.

@fxnleisure  @FoxNews   Don’t we all wink wink
@fxnleisure  @FoxNews  wait... If they eat meat then they are not vegetarians so... It's still 100% don't eat meat when drunk.
@fxnleisure  @FoxNews  yeah they do...
@fxnleisure  @FoxNews  A vegetarian martini should never be made with Beefeaters.
@fxnleisure  @FoxNews  that just proves one thing....Carnivals
@fxnleisure  @FoxNews  Naw…but it may look like it.
@fxnleisure  @foxnews  I get it, exposing universal hypocrisy.
@fxnleisure  @FoxNews  alcohol causes you to not think coherently causing you to resort to natural basic instinct. Which is to eat meat
@fxnleisure  @thelabellessone
@fxnleisure  @FoxNews  PC bullshit and hypocrisy.
@fxnleisure  @FoxNews   I knew it! Hypocrites!  and there the same who say "don't drink diet cokes!"  while they drink 32oz sugary slurpees!
@fxnleisure  @FoxNews  ... Now that is funny! #harmless #betterthansmokeing

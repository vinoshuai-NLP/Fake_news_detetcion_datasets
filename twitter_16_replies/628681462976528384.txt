Ahem..  @IrritableBowel2  @CBSNews
@CBSNews  If someone wants to buy it, who are you to tell them they can't. I think $4 for a bottle of water is ridiculous but people pay it.
@CBSNews  Was anyone buying this, really?
. @CBSNews  is it organic though?
@CBSNews  @KarissaManis No one is forced to pay that.  Not like health care, where people often go broke for life saving medical assistance.
@tobylaek  @CBSNews  very true! I don't know why anyone would pay that.
@CBSNews  @CBSSacramento  ridiculous
@CBSNews  @MrSinister53  Much too concentrated to be a cure for Asperges syndrome!
@CBSNews  @TurntableKittah  Call themselves out for being #Lemmings if they bought it. What's the big deal?
@JGB331  @CBSNews  $6? For two stalks of asparagus in processed water?
@CBSNews  capitalism - if people but it they keep selling it. Does the news have to now tell people when they are dumb?
@CodyTruesdale69  @CBSNews  Whole Foods is an organization that relies on gullibility to make profits.
@CBSNews  @MERRYMAJESTY  What's next, gluten-free bacon, or perhaps Twinkies stuffed with gravel... https://twitter.com/cbsnews/status/628681462976528384â€¦ @jodotcom  @DaleF3

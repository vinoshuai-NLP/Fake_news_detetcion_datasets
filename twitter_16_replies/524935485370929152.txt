@Ahmed__Hussain_  @Eren__Jeager  @ummsalama15_ Nope. Never agreed with you.
@Ahmed__Hussain_  @ummsalama15_ Some media owned by Jews. Some by Christians. Many by Muslims. You just have 2 have actually worked
@Ahmed__Hussain_  @Eren__Jeager  To be a state, you have to - at the MINIMUM - have been acknowledged by 1 other state. ISIS acknowledged by 0
@KnwldgePrecedes  Here is one from last month: http://nytimes.com/2014/09/29/world/in-pakistans-tribal-north-us-drone-strike-kills-four.html…
@AbuJabir_1 There is a lot of debate on the legality of drone strikes. And no one thinks that civilian casualties are ok.
@KnwldgePrecedes  That would be an important story if we could report it. But no one can go into Syria safely right now. So it's being missed
@KnwldgePrecedes  I don't think that anything I say will satisfy you. So I will be signing off for now. Have a good day.
@Ahmed__Hussain_  @Eren__Jeager  I did watch. & I also know that he was only allowed inside by having an IS "minder" at his side= censorship
@Ahmed__Hussain_  @Eren__Jeager  See HuffPo “These are managed trips, so you are there with their permission." http://huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/07/vice-islamic-state_n_5656202.html…
@Ahmed__Hussain_  @Eren__Jeager  Riiiiiiiggggght. ... Which is why the reporter's editor is saying there was a minder? Yes I did watch.

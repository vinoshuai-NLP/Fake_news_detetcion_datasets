@RichardLochhead  @theSNP  or they could just offer paper bag and cut corporate greed
@RichardLochhead  @Woodcote249  "fewer" not "less"! #pedantry
@chrishawtree  @RichardLochhead  "Less" uses fewer characters. #pedantindeed
@RichardLochhead  @BBCScotlandNews  couldn't that money be used to end food banks here.
@RichardLochhead   use the money to end food banks then.
@RichardLochhead  @AlexSalmond    Tesco's has had a no bag policy offering customers points for no bags for about 2 yrs.
@RichardLochhead  @BBCScotlandNews  I'd like to know which gvmnt gets the tax portion of the 5p charge...holyrood or wstmnstr??
@RichardLochhead  @AlexSalmond  @BBCScotlandNews   Can you name good causes that got the 7 million ?
@RichardLochhead  @theSNP  are there any checks or any way of knowing retailers are passing the charge on to good causes instead of keeping it
@RichardLochhead  @AlexSalmond  Well done the SNP it is the only thing you have done put the money to NHS
@RichardLochhead  @IndiScoLady  @BBCScotlandNews  and yet like poll tax England only getting it now
@donnamesser1972  @RichardLochhead  @BBCScotlandNews  hahaha did you see it made headline news on tv above like real news
@RichardLochhead   always amazed that a small charge has such a big effect. But very glad it does. 50p charge for plastic straws next?
@RichardLochhead  @dadbegg  @BBCScotlandNews  less bags?  Clearly haven't seen my hall cupboard
@RichardLochhead  @DavidJFHalliday  Next step, stop making the bags in first place, to reduce waste, and donate 5ps instead. #buyabasket
@Zarkwan  @RichardLochhead  @DavidJFHalliday  How much will it cost retailers to replace all the stolen baskets?
@RichardLochhead  @AngusRobertson  Yes indeed - so we can tick off ONE item from the list of hundreds of SNP promises.... plastic bags

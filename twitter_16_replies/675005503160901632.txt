@AP_Politics  @AP  Hypocrite!
@AP_Politics  this so-called loophole doesn't exist, so it's easy to close.
@AP_Politics  @AP  I guess he wants us to think he is doing something about "terrorism". To bad terrorists don't buy guns legally..SILLY!
@AP_Politics  @AP  #passabill
@AP_Politics  @AP  The only way to buy guns online "without a background check" is to become an FFL, which ITSELF REQUIRES a background check.
@AP_Politics  What the H do we have a Congress for, when they are useless in Obama's eyes!
@AP_Politics  @AP  Why does president want to go around our democratic system of government?
@AP_Politics  @AP  If they refuse to work with you, work around them. Worthless congress.
Obama says "Fuck the Constitution!" will bypass Congress, use executive order to strip you of 2A rights  @AP_Politics
@AP_Politics  @AP   Violating constitutional rights through Exec Order. How FDR of him.
@darkob  @AP_Politics  except bush used WAY more executive orders than Obama. Historically speaking Obama hasn't used a lot
@JT_Lucid  @darkob  @AP_Politics  there is a huge difference in the content of what they used them on
@darkob  @AP_Politics  variety of things. But here's number of executive orders by president. Not arguing, just saying
@AP_Politics  @MiddleAmericaMS  Just do it.
@AP_Politics  @AP  just waiting till 4:30 pm on a Friday to announce.
@darkob  @bsecia  @AP_Politics  many want to. But have no valid reason. And honestly, have become very lazy and complacent.
@twelch65  @AP_Politics  More lives could have been saved if so many politicians weren't in the back pocket of the NRA... many to blame...
@AP_Politics  Obama is HITLER.

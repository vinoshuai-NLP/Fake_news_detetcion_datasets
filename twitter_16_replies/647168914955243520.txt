@ericbradner  @TheBlazeNOW why do they poll someone not declared?
@ericbradner  Thatâ€™s a big margin of error, too. Curious to see how the actual voting goes.
@ericbradner  @katherinemiller  What about@LincolnChafee?
@ericbradner  perhaps you've noticed Sanders a next door neighbor in Vermont, w similar pol demo, both states No minorities  @ReformedBroker
@ericbradner  @RichLowry  I guess Bernie Sanders is cutting off Hillary Clinton balls off huh??  your such a douche
@ericbradner  lol ur candidate is garbo bruh  @Kev_in_Iowa  @enquiry_mike  @deanwball
@ericbradner  @RichLowry  Lol so an old white socialist is the best they can do on the left? Proves me right party is now officially socialist
@ericbradner  @politicsnhiphop And without Biden?
@ericbradner  @politicsnhiphop BFD. Iowa and New Hampshire between them have about 1.4% of delegates needed to win the nomination.
@johnavignone  @ericbradner  @politicsnhiphop "what is momentum". Do you remember what happened to Hillary after she lost Iowa in 2008? 
@ericbradner  @politicsnhiphop Any talk of a Clinton-Biden-O'Malley coalition to defeat Sanders?
@ericbradner  @TheBenWalters  Freeking insane no matter who is on top.
. @ericbradner  @RichLowry  Say HELLO to a Joe Biden / Elizabeth Warren ticket in 2016 @HillaryClinton  is TOAST
@ericbradner  @richlowry   Are you gay lowry? We were wondering?
. @ericbradner  @ItsJustJill  How's old Bernie's foreign policy. Does he want our military to share their bullet proof vest? How about bullets?
@ericbradner  @RichLowry  Some say "Socialist."  But if he's one for fighting #NAFTA-#TPP (real cause of deficit)--then he's a blooming saint!
Ahhhh...the left....the commie, the corrupt, the clown ....what a field!!!  @ericbradner  @RichLowry

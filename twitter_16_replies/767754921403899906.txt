How many more lives will be lost until Trump becomes President? Nothing worked in the past, nothing will end if Hillary is POTUS

Israel can b a part of this one.
Why are the Syrian men of fighting age LEAVING their country?Why are they NOT fighting against the Terrorists?
Sounds like they are using the Democrat playbook - get them while they are young. Absolutely disgusting. What a horrible tragedy.
I suppose ISIS thinks this is something to be proud of. How insane can they be. These people are a curse on civilization.
islam has nothing to do with islam
Pure evil. ISIS needs to be world enemy number 1...way too many attacks still.

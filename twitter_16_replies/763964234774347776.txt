That's a lot of fried chicken and weed.
thank you
A far better use would have been a relief fund for families of #BlackonBlack murder victims.
the whole BLM thing is ridiculous anyhow all it does is cause more tension
I find it hard 2 believe a cop starts out his day sayin I'm goin 2 kill black man
Bravo weeknd  ... I hope other stars follow suit!
it does work. If ur not involved in criminal activities & avoid appearance of it
respect & do what is asked of u when confronted by cops this shit wouldn't happen
in each event the murdered subject is doing somethin illegal &/or resistin arrest
why do you care?  @theweeknd  can do whatever he wants. #Often   @CNNent
that is ridiculous! I find that hard to believe cops just kill black people for the fun of it. That just doesn't happen
it if you're stopped do like everybody else does make sure your hands are visible, comply with a cop. Not figit around or run
that cop wants to go home to his family at the end of the day. He's out there to keep the community safe not kill people
To be honest if they don't think that, they need to change their approach. It comes off that way

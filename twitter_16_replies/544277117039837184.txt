@rachflit  @SkyNewsAust  you say what? Blackout? How will the hide the budget then?
@SkyNewsAust  @liztilley84  good to see somebody did some research   #SydneySiege
@SkyNewsAust  @liztilley84    Who cares about the flag, the people being held hostage are more important.
@SkyNewsAust  @conkc2  @liztilley84  Muhammad would be the guy with the 9 yr old wives and the order of death to infidels? What's the diff?
@SkyNewsAust  @liztilley84  @AB_Owl  Not a great comfort but an important detail to emphasise.
@SkyNewsAust  @HRHgearoid  same shit
@SkyNewsAust  @liztilley84  so why can't  @SkyNews  tell us the same
@DrozAnn  @SkyNewsAust  @liztilley84  yeah send them to Kobane in Syria..
@SkyNewsAust  so its not an IS flag - must be a peaceful Islamic extremist group then!
@col_livesey  @BasimaFaysal  @SkyNewsAust   It is according to this terrorism expert http://abc.net.au/newsradio/content/s4148817.htm…
@SkyNewsAust  Is Sydney airspace closed.
@SkyNewsAust  both flags read the same, so does AQ flag. But not Daesh/IS flag. Focus should be on nr of hostages and situation  @Beltrew
“ @SkyNewsAust : Flag in Sydney cafe not ISIS flag. Reads: ‘There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is the messenger of God’ ( @liztilley84 )”
@SkyNewsAust  @pukeko65  @liztilley84  Seems to contradict its self a little!
@SkyNewsAust  @pukeko65  @liztilley84  Only one way to deal with these sorts of scum, separate their bodies from their breath!
@SkyNewsAust  @liztilley84   Obsession
@SkyNewsAust  @liztilley84   Learn some arabic mate. It says "total assole with gun inside"

@brianmoore666  I think she's nailed it pretty well in this letter. Question is would it have the necessary impact with the Trumplodites??
@tmdavies1964  No but it might influe3nce a few people considering supporting him; which cannot be bad.
@brianmoore666  if he actually wins..can you imagine this clown dealing with world leaders over international matters? Scary prospect!
@AndyAlfisti  Scary but he won't win.
@brianmoore666  Probably hire that daft Morgan now.
@tommckibbin  @brianmoore666  I see what Brian Poo(re) has done there - clever word play
@brianmoore666  Having followed the tweets from the twats that support him. I don't think they could read half of it
@brianmoore666  astonishing!
@brianmoore666  Indeed.  However Ted Cruz is an even scarier proposition than Trump.  He actually believes the nonsense he spouts.
@brianmoore666  How can he be allowed to run when he is being sued for his failed business

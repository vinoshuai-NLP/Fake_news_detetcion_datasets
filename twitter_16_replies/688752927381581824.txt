@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  ...guess no biggie about them breaking Geneva Convention by releasing pics of our sailors? Goodwill and all, amirite?
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  @TheIranDeal   Liar AND traitor!
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  Risked safety of US & Israel & gave Iran a billion to buy more weapons. Speech on Sunday so people aren't watching? Smart
@Inspireluv  @WhiteHouse  @POTUS  and I'm sure u have examined every deal that has been made in American history. Listen to Trump much?

@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  YOU GAVE AWAY THE FARM. SELL CHEESEBURGERS! !##
@WhiteHouse  @StateDept  @POTUS  well done
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  That's why #Iran paraded your 10 sailors on public tv in a blatant violation of the Geneva Conventions
“ @WhiteHouse : "..these things are a reminder of what we can achieve when we lead with strength and wisdom." — @POTUS  on progress with Iran”
@WhiteHouse  @WHLive  @POTUS
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  amen about that
@Inspireluv  @WhiteHouse  @POTUS  my apologies in the trump assertion. My point is how can we just make just a broad statement dooming the deal
@Inspireluv  @WhiteHouse  @POTUS  don't we need to let history tell us that?
@Inspireluv  @WhiteHouse  @POTUS   I'm not arguing ur premise.  I haven't examine all deals in am history so I can't say I know either way..
@Inspireluv  @WhiteHouse  @POTUS  my point is I'm sure like previous deals we couldn't state either way of success a few months in
@Inspireluv  @WhiteHouse  @POTUS  u could be correct. But how do we know at this point is my question.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS   this is a fact. Iran has lead this whole deal with strength and wisdom..plus Deception

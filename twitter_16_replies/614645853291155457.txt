“ @thehill :  @stacylb  White House lights up rainbow colors to celebrate SCOTUS ruling: http://hill.cm/hzBIHeI ”
@thehill  seems the WH knew the ruling before it ever was announced..
@thehill  does the sign on the front door say Enter in the Resr
“ @thehill : As sun goes down, White House lights up rainbow colors to celebrate SCOTUS ruling:"  Good Lord!
@thehill  Can we feel any better to have Obama as our leader? Pride is what I feel and I don't often feel that way.

@thehill
@thehill  the only colors that the  WH should bear are red, white, and blue in honor of members of our armed forces and veterans.
@thehill  but that will never happen with our prez who insists in destroying everything America once stood for.
@thehill  should only be this  can't have a confederate flag but can have a rainbow should be neutral in the issue

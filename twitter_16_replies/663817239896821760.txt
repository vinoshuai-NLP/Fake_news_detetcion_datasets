@BuzzFeed  I left Starbucks when CEO said 'if you support traditional #marriage feel free to invest elsewhere' so I have #nostarbucksforme
@dhyancey  @BuzzFeed  That's not what he said.
@BuzzFeed  @DeadsyDoll  hahaha
@BuzzFeed  Rude. The red cups are a reminder of the approaching holiday season! C'mon. (BTW, I already have Jesus, or rather He has me).
@BuzzFeed  @caitlynbeth_3  It's just a Cup!
@BuzzFeed  dumbest controversial cup and can't believe it's a topic. Good grief
@BuzzFeed  OMG!! What terrifies me the most is that some people are actually talking seriously about it! Ignorance is dangerous
@BuzzFeed  amen... Freaking amen!
@BuzzFeed  no such thing as bad publicity! Thanks simple red cup!-Starbucks Executive
@BuzzFeed  @meghanfaceeee  Doesn't that apply to the people Starbucks is trying to defend??
@BuzzFeed  ohhhh ROASTED!! THANK YOU FINALLY SOMEONE SAID IT!! This is for you @veronicake1  @diansicle

@BuzzFeed  I'm glad people are going to stop buying coffee at Starbucks.  It'll make getting my coffee that much faster.

@BuzzFeed   I thought the red cup during the holidays represented Christmas in the first place. Who cares if it has a snow flake or not

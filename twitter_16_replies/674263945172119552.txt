@RollingStone  @davehydesports  you mean killed by people. Why shift the blame?
@GiachinoJolley  @RollingStone  @davehydesports  People with ready access to damn near any gun in existence for their well-regulated militia.
@RollingStone  @gardencatlady   This is one Tweet that I can't like. Thank You!
@RollingStone  //Make Love Not weapon 
@RollingStone  @andreapetkovic  Guns don't kill people, people kill people. Because they have guns.
@Cinetti  @RollingStone  @Martina   Please keep civilization alive, England. As you'll see from many American replies here, we quit long ago.
@Petkopova  @Cinetti  @RollingStone  @Martina  thanks we will try in london.
@RollingStone  @yankeebluenose8  - About same # of abortions performed in 1980 alone. Since 1980 there have been over 23 million babies killed
@RollingStone  @ShaunKing  A bullcrap slanted stat without context.
@RollingStone  Oh man...we need you and your songs today more than ever! You will be forever missed.
@RollingStone  @ShaunKing  Ultimate hipster move. Getting shot before everyone else.
@RollingStone  Guns don't kill people you idiots, people do. No matter how much gun control you push 4 the bad guys will ALWAYS get them.
@RollingStone  @ShaunKing  well this is some random shit!!!
@Cyrus_is_risen  @ztubert  @RollingStone  I wasn't judging you.
@Cyrus_is_risen  @BrianPHickey  @RollingStone  
@RollingStone  @randyprine Oh, John! We Miss U ~ Still!
@ScottiBy_  @RollingStone  I know but not American
@ScottiBy_  @RollingStone  they should've said killed in America not Americans killed
@RollingStone  @IEBergant  just a number. No real statistic, no context. Could as well say "cars" or "sugar", for example.
@RollingStone  they're all nutters guns were made just to kill things it ain't good at all
@ScottiBy_  @RollingStone  people interpret things differently. It did to me
@RollingStone  @robdowde  Not so hot on animals, however- Yoko had a room full of fur coats.
@RollingStone  @TheMurdochTimes Yeah man its all Lennons fault!
@missbcarman  @RollingStone  yes, but people without guns can't shoot.
@missbcarman  @Petkopova  @RollingStone  the most stupid comment in the history of recorded time.
@missbcarman  @Petkopova  @RollingStone  Er yes, that is the point. That people have access to, and are pulling the triggers......
@RollingStone  @antonnewcombe  surely a typo there....?
@cowley68  @RollingStone  it's interesting that they would use 1.15 instead of 1.1 or simply say 1,150,000+ people -
@RollingStone  He was awesome. One of the people I would to speak to, if I could.
@RollingStone  @gkketch  guns don't kill people on their own.
@missbcarman  @RollingStone  and cars don't crash themselves, but we have a seatbelt.
@RollingStone  have you heard about our new Christmas charity single #500miles Released for download today. http://itun.es/gb/7gTG_
@missbcarman  @Petkopova  @RollingStone  let's ban alcohol first 
@RollingStone  @andreapetkovic  No weapons that kill, it is the man that kills! Especially those who speak of peace, equality among people.
@RollingStone  @LOLGOP  ONE POINT ONE FIVE MILLION!
@RollingStone  @cerysmatthews  That's just such a breathtaking statistic-if we STOP and THINK!
@missbcarman  @Petkopova  @RollingStone  That is obviously what it means. We all know that guns don't fire themselves. That is the whole point.
@RollingStone  Most of them in places with extreme gun control. (just keeping it fair and balanced)

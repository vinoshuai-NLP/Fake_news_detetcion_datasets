@BuzzFeed  Well this is also dangerous. Are there any stairs?
@BuzzFeed  So I guess planking is gonna have its comeback in China these days.
@Voldsby  @BuzzFeed  Yup.
@BuzzFeed  lol
@BuzzFeed  The lady that died on them didn't listen to the mechanic who was closing it. How about China shows courtesy and listen to people.
@BuzzFeed  and this is somehow better than stairs.
@BuzzFeed  desde essa notícia tenho evitado todas as escadas rolantes aqui no Brasil mesmo :/ so sad
@BuzzFeed  
@BuzzFeed  i'd rather ride the stairs
@BuzzFeed  well that wouldn't help if the bottom fell out the way it did before lol.
o_O RT  @BuzzFeed : This is how people in China are riding escalators after a horrific accident http://bzfd.it/1IsJbF2
@BuzzFeed  maybe taking the stairs would be a little easier in these cases..
@BuzzFeed  super. thank goodness the cameras are (still) there.
@BuzzFeed  where are the stairs
@erbearrr432  @BuzzFeed  @Samwestfall26 HAHAHA

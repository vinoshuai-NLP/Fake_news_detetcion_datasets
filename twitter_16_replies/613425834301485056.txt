@TheRoot  @99AndThe2000  @BurgerKing  when having it your way goes wrong...
@TheRoot  @BurgerKing  Focusing on ways cops exercised #WhitePrivilege distracts from real issue--a #racist White man killed 9 Black folks.
@TheRoot  @IAmSophiaNelson  @BurgerKing  The same way the Germanwings pilot was shown doing charity work. Racism stinls!
@TheRoot  @BurgerKing  soooo in others words negatively reinforcing this lunatics thoughts and actions
@TheRoot  @IAmSophiaNelson  @BurgerKing  white suspect, white police yeah they looked out for him
@TheRoot  @HaroldWNelson  @BurgerKing   The kind of cops  we DON'T need,they should be Fired. That was a stamp of approval ,#ok 2 murder Blacks
Private plane, not a commercial flight.  @twitphoebia  @TheRoot  @BurgerKing
@TheRoot  "asset" I think the operative word is "bought their 'asset' food"... It is already hitting the fan~
@TheRoot  @BurgerKing   Is this a plane? First class? Is Zimmerman there to comfort him?
@TheRoot  private plane! Should have thrown him in the rear of a police van and let him roll around, maybe broken his neck by mistake
@TheRoot  @BurgerKing  Hey, if that helped get a confession out of the murderous skunk faster, I got no problem with it.

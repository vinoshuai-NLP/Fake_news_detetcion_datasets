@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  probably is as watertight an accusation as allegedly
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  lol ya think??
@musback  Breaking means news just come in. Ie. The verdict has just come in and that's what it is.
@BBCBreaking  So Putin "probably" approved Litvinenko's assassination in 2006. 'BBC', you are as sick as the Public Inquiry people.
@BBCBreaking  The cost of being a snitch.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  how is this shocking? It's not the first, and not the last by any first world government! #nothingnew
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Well, colour me surprised!
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  course he did. Didn't take an enquiry to tell anyone that
@BBCBreaking  "Probably" "Probably not" How credible???
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  the guys a nutter he needs locking up along with Kim Jong un
@BBCBreaking  @BBC_ua  Dave Cameron "probably" is a Nazi. BBC "probably" is being paid by Pakistani intelligence. #probably
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  So the Inquiry has no proof he did. "Probably" doesn't mean "Certainly".  Stop distorting the facts, BBC bastards.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  I agree. Why should this be breaking news
@BBCBreaking  @BBCWorld  @BBCNews   Omg
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  but then again, he "probably" didn't.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Почему-то никто не удивлен!
@BBCBreaking  Western "war gangs" are using the "JUSTICE" now to provoke war and punish Putin.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Blair took us into a war, Cameron another, millions killed and displaced, Russia like ourselves deals with espionage
@BBCBreaking  @BBCWorld  @BBCNews  time to crackdown on Russians in London. Will #piggate #cameron stop #kowtowing & finally do something ?
@BBCBreaking  @BBCWorld  @BBCNews  The Russians viewed him as a traitor and many feel traitors should be executed.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  is the economic system that broken that we are now looking 4 any reasons 2 start the next world war???
@BBCBreaking  Well.... it's good to know the money spent on this enquiry resulted in a definite conclusion #probably
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  probably!!! It should be yes or no.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  the news has probably been simmering in the case files of news reporting agencies, such the BBC ever since.
@BBCBreaking  What is the difference between KGB and the IM6..
@BBCBreaking  so this man murdered because he dare speak out.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  It happens all the time Obama approved the killing an American citizen and his16yr.old son via a drone strike in Yemen

@BBCBreaking  @TraffordLj  It's probably going to rain today.
@Del_ivered  In fact case I'll avoid dodgy looking men with pointy umbrellas on Westminster bridge.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Ultimately this inquiry's findings changes nothing. The Govt cannot and will not jeopardise relations with Russia.
@BBCBreaking  Who cares 10 years on about a Russian spy! Have we not got better things to think about at the present time.

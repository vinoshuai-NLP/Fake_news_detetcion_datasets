@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  THAT DOESN'T HELP MY OTHER SON WHO MANAGED TO GRADUATE but is frustrated with life in let's kill our enemy-ville  @pretend
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  maybe thats because standards are so low that you can graduate without basic reading and comprehension skills
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  why gave this twisting statement. Simpley you may say this is your ..
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  OK. What you want to say?
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  So now compare this map with newl Employed map
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  Success!!!!
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  Now schools should go beyond teaching to the tests.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  WTF are you taking credit for? You & wifey are responsible for the lunches being tossed out. Take credit for that waste.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  haha yeah because they're pushed through with a giant broom and a blind fold over their eyes
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  Obama's typical manipulated stats, STOP LYING! Diploma's easier, dropouts off books; GED, back to Mex, homeschooled?SUCKS
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  I was a transfer student from YonseiU(Biochem 1983-1991,1999-2000 Seoul Korea)2IowaStateU(AeroE adviserDr.JMVogel1991-97)
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  U can see the certificates of enrollment at my tweet account photos.ISU treated me very unfairly insults threats...etc
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  That may be so; but what do they know. To graduate is not equivalent to being educated.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  They cancelled my registration in 1997..During the last 19 yrs I have sent  requests2investigate n recover my damages..
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  But nothing happened  I think it is very wrong n unfair..If I have to fight against ISU wrong treatments in court I will
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  lowering the bar is working.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  Our college education curriculum is antiquated. Worthless requirements milking students money.  Nothing to do w/major.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  Yes Mr President, we need to improve on that however.  Our education levels don't compete with many others.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  Lower the standards, pass kids who don't deserve it, and brag about increasing the graduation rates?
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS    tech doing all the footwork. Most don't know multiplicationThe smarter tech the dumber we become. Smartphone dumb brain
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS   dumbing down school testing doesn't help young adults, doesn't make for a smart workforce.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  That is great number.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS   7% feels rather blown out of proportion. Still an improvement though
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  I believe it is easier to graduate now!  Any of them really ready for college?  Oops minor problem!
. @WhiteHouse  @rebeccanatow  @POTUS  Great trend, but too many grads need developmental courses in college. Diploma should mean #CollegeReady!!
. @WhiteHouse  @POTUS  #ThanksObama

@cnni  @realDonaldTrump  Donald Gump, you are a natural comedian.  You might want to consider changing career.
@cnni  Geez people are idiots.
@cnni  Really, you got to be kidding me. What's wrong with Trump? It's just a cup.#starbuckschristmas is a great design.
@cnni  if  @realDonaldTrump  really thinks the meaning of Christmas is in a cup design,   He's missed the true meaning! #MorethanaCup
@cnni  DONAL MADURO TRUMP 
@cnni  it's a paper cup people! Is it really an issue of anti Christmas? I think not.It could be viewed as the anti commercialization
@cnni  is Starbucks another product from the Kenyan immigrants? just asking? then why boycott?
@cnni  does Trump even drink coffee...?
@cnni  Be sure to wish  @Starbucks  a very Merry Christmas #WarOnChristmas https://youtube.com/watch?v=el7M9K1kBl8â€¦
@cnni  you aren't even a Christian.all you want to do is buy votes.
@cnni  not difficult to "defend Christmas". We all know the fables.
@cnni  He's right.things have become too politically correct.
@cnni  Will he become President or is he going to run out of steam. Moon turned into a Swan in England
@cnni :  @cnni  really? You're reporting that?  Christmas is about a red cup? Is DT one of the wise men?  craving coffee now. #SMH
@cnni  @realDonaldTrump  maybe we should boycott your hair.
@cnni  TRUMP'S PROMISE: IF I AM PRESIDENT, I WILL KEEP OUR FLAG RED, WHITE AND BLUE NO APOLOGY FOR BEING AMERICANS
@cnni

@cnni  Maybe Mr. Trump does not have any more serious issues to focus on.
@cnni  uh...he also said "I don't care". Stop reporting misleading news.

@KestrelArts  @jimEastridge1  @dmcparson  I also think the stats are fake. I did follow the news, and I haven't got impression so much change.
@Fictonic The FBI defines a "mass shooting" as 4 or more fatalities in a single event, excluding gang violence or domestic (home) incidents.
@jimEastridge1  @dmcparson  Even by casualties its wrong: 426 (226 lethal) under Obama vs 211 (121 lethal) under Bush.
@Fictonic  @jimEastridge1  @AngieDrue  You know it is racist to mention the homicide rate in  @POTUS  town!
@jimEastridge1  @MhEfren  them why a Nobel peace ?
@jimEastridge1  @SteveDeaceShow  Maybe we need to eliminate Democratic presidents instead of guns.
@jimEastridge1  Please send this to  @oreillyfactor  @greta  @megynkelly  @HillaryClinton  @DiamondandSilk  @chrislhayes  #rollcall #msm
@jimEastridge1  @JamesRitch1 OBAMA, CLINTON Then BUSH .
@jimEastridge1  @JamesRitch1 He created this angry, agitated environment. He's responsible.
@jimEastridge1  @WarriorsHart444  Gotta remind him what it was like in Chicago when he was organizing.
@jimEastridge1  NO ILLEGALS AND NO REFUGEES PERIOD VETERANS FIRST ALWAYS! THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE
Maybe it's due to a WEAK #POTUS who's incited more hate & divide #GunsAreNotTheProblem  @jimEastridge1
@jimEastridge1   The New World Order.  Inciting hatred and dividing us.
@jimEastridge1  This is not an Anti-Obama post this is an Anti-gun post. Ridiculous how people blame guns for terrorism...
@jimEastridge1  @PrisonerNo24601  And?
@jimEastridge1  @PrisonerNo24601  Gun murder rates have been falling yearly since the mid-90s. Blame the gangs in the big cities.

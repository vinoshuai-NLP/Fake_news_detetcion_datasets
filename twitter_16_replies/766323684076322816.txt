Private prisons have been a way to escape responsibility for the humanity inside. Nice to see their stocks have tanked.  @POTUS
just give free passes to criminals like they did for Hillary
I guess that last season of orange is the new black had an affect LOL
good, they were only in it for the money
crony capitalism is the reason private prisons do not work

@CNNMoney  question unanswered... Where are those 195,000 going to go? Federal prisons? Back on the street?

FEDS,ðŸ›‡$: RACIST PRIVATE PRISONS GIULIANI-GREENBERG TRAURIG BLOWS  @cnnbrk  @UN  @BBC  @NPR  @espn  @TMZ  @AP  @latimes  @NYDailyNews  ISRAEL=HOLLYWOOD
@CNNMoney  Private prisons immoral, pure and simple.
YES ITS ABOUT TIME
Why? Cause Killery harps on it? Prisoners treated to mean? Let death row stay loaded? Libtards unhappy?
@michaelshure  @CNNMoney  Now that is actual breaking news.
Private prisons have done nothing but profit off of the  misery of people while encouraging further mass incarceration.
It's not enough to close down prisons. There needs to be more comprehensive reform of the justice system.
Justice department phasing out use of private prisons. Is that good news?
depends are you A liberal or a conservative
It is about time to shut these prisons down,because they use ppl for their gain is wrong,,

Why?  So they can set free those they want to set free? I have totally lost faith in the DOJ & our justice system in general!

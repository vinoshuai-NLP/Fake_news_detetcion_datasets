@eonline  Always Rickman 
@AccioDanHP Always.
@eonline  
@eonline  what a loss
@eonline  He made the perfect intimidating teacher-we all thought was the villain-turns out to be protector and savior. Beloved actor!!!!!
@eonline  Throughout my early life and adolescence, me and my brother would watch #HarryPotter and Rickman's Snape was a class act!!!!!
@eonline  Rickman will forever be one of our most beloved actors, not just as part of the #HarryPotter family, but OUR individual families!!!
@eonline  so sad. Rest in peace friend!

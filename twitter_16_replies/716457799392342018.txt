@TeenForBernie  @Women4Bernie  I don't get it.  NYT results linked still show Hillary won...
@RTRustBelt  @Women4Bernie
@TeenForBernie  Boom!
@TeenForBernie  @Women4Bernie  @BernieSanders  @People4Bernie  @Bernlennials  Why do you keep tweeting that? It's  not true yet. One more 2 go!
@fridapoco  @TeenForBernie  @Women4Bernie  @BernieSanders  @People4Bernie  @Bernlennials  He won Clark County & more delegates, via  @lasvegassun  
@TeenForBernie  @Women4Bernie  @BernieSanders  @People4Bernie  @Bernlennials  Totally confuses me. Caucus was in Feb, today was state convention.

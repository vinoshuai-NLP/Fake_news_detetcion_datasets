@espn  that's a huge insult to every coach in the east
@espn  Pop is goat
@espn  Like WTF. Is The NBA stupid. Dwane Casey is a much better choice.
@espn  its a disgrace that nba is letting lue not blatt coach in allstar. Not a class act. Another reason i hate the cavs. Stinky and cocky
@espn  What a joke of a league.
@espn  All celebrities s*xy nak*d pics http://goo.gl/mhgYjZ (coached coached 3 ) https://pic.twitter.com/SJC59QJzX2
@espn  this is so wrong. He should not be coaching Allstate game!!
@espn  Luke Walton gets 0 credit for GSW wins but Lue gets to coach All-Star game. SMH.  @NBA  got this one wrong. Shameful
@espn  hey  @NBA  this is a joke, right?
@espn  lue should not accept that and give it to raptors coach casey
@espn  joke. Tyronn is weak he'll be fired soon.
@espn  who cares about the ASG?
@espn  and Pop has the higher #NBA  career winning percentage.
@espn  @cavs  and how many games has mr Lue won? If he had any pride, he would skip the all-star game.
@espn  does he get a special ASG booster seat
@espn  So, black coach reaping the white man's benefits?
@espn  Lue accepting the invite is ridiculous. Absolutely. Ridiculous.
@espn  But they almost have the same winning percentage! Pops 69%, Lue 67%. That's what the NBA was probably thinking when they chose him :P
@espn  waiting for the punchline to this joke.
@espn  exactly. I'm boycotting the allstar game in respect to David blatt
@espn  if Lue is allowed to coach the allstars, Luke should too.
@espn  should be Casey. Or else give Walton the job in West
@espn  it's just stupid
@espn  NBA should bring blat back for this one game.
@espn  what an absolute joke. My hope is the Cavs are repaid for this drama with another drubbing from the #GoldenStateWarriors
@espn  what #cavaliers did to #daveblatt is unconscionable
@kennys001  @espn  cheers I remember you
@espn  that's crazy. Wonder if he'll get the respect of the all stars as a HC
@espn  NBA sucks!
@espn  = no chance for LeBron. #SpursNation #GoldenStateWarriors. Might as well retire and let everyone wonder what if???...
@espn  What a total joke!
@espn   Man this is BS, The NBA is a fricken joke! May as well be WWF!
@espn  What happened to Casey? Can't believe this. Pathetic move by the NBA
@espn  complete joke, even if blatt didn't get fired it should have been Dwayne Casey. Games in Toronto, raps are hot, makes no sense
@espn  why is lue coaching the all star game when he just coach for 3 games wow cavs are embarrassment to the league. Inmates run the asylum.
@espn  the NBA is a joke with this...they can't say sorry you aren't deserving and put another coach there! As bad as the NFL pro bowl draft
@espn  NBA board is confused
@espn  it really is rediculous that Lue is the all star game coach.  Hasn't earned it, should be Dwane Casey.

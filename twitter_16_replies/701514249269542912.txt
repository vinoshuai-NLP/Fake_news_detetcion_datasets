@nytimes  oh so the polls you normally use suddenly have less value when it doesn't fit your candidate's narrative?
@nytimes  I'm getting really close to unsubscribing/unfollowing NYTs. Completely pathetic propaganda.
@nytimes  ...said the people who donated to her campaign. Integrity much?
@nytimes  nice try. I'll stick with the facts. Bernie crushed the Latino vote in NV.
@igmcdizzy  @nytimes  No he didn't!  Truth hurts, I know.
@nytimes  this is how she won #pandering
@nytimes  WRONG. I don't read, share, or support you anymore but have some integrity & please be a real journal again for your poor readers.
@nytimes  why don't change name to NYHillaryTimes?
@nytimes  Time to stop the lies, Stop the Bern. He is no Democrat, has no Faith, he's running on a fantasy.Lets hear some real talk.
@bridaniels  @nytimes  @politico  If you were a actually listening at TH, she said base 12 and support up to 15.  #facts
@nytimes  ... this is so true!
@nytimes  Bernie sanders voting record is Enough to convince. Any Latino he's the best choice. Talk is cheap, NYT seems weak on this point.
@nytimes   No, the "negative Bernie Sanders polling headline" is more Wall Street swag for the New York Times.
@nytimes  she won Nevada by measly 650 votes, he won N.H. by 50k votes. things MSM won't tell you.

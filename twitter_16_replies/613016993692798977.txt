@Nettaaaaaaaa  some are saying that it's a way to earn the trust of the shooter, make things easier in interrogation. I still dont agree tho
@Psychonaut421  -________- that's the wildest thing ever. Ppl love to justify bs.

@Nettaaaaaaaa  To put it in a more simple form ,just how many homeless people have those same police taken to Burger Kings?

@WebnetJacob  @CNNPolitics  @CNN  @jennagiesta  sorry don't view cartoons I'm sure Garfield was real cute. So you have no original thought.
@CNNPolitics  @Law1Gloria  @jennagiesta  PUH!
 “ @CNNPolitics : CNN/ORC Poll: Trump now competitive in general election http://cnn.it/1Jhw71i via  @jennagiesta  ”
@CNNPolitics  @PatriotKolomna  @jennagiesta  как-бы по динамике должна быть баба-лесбиянка, но похоже мадам переистерила и у Трампа есть шанс
@CNNPolitics  @CNN  @jennagiesta  Trump is nothing but entertainment and the show is winding down. Boring! Take his money & buy some class!
@CNNPolitics  @jennagiesta  The real headline  is: Despite A Drubbing By The Media And 17 Republican Candidates Hillary Maintains Her Lead..
@WebnetJacob  @CNNPolitics  @CNN  @jennagiesta  again I have cartoons and meme blocked so you are posting a blank page to me
@CNNPolitics  @CNN  @jennagiesta  ugh to both.
@CNNPolitics  @CNN  @jennagiesta  can you believe it?  I'm sure she wasn't thinking that he would be her chief rival
@CNNPolitics  @CNN  @jennagiesta  This is temporary Trump is a distraction
@CNNPolitics  @jennagiesta  scary that these are our choices 
@CNNPolitics  @jennagiesta  @ImmortalCritic  when will the dems realise that hillary is damaged #emails
@corvedacosta  but Corve, ur more aligned to Republican thinking so of course she's not fit to rule lol!
@CNNPolitics  @jennagiesta  Sounds like someone objected to our reality and submitted Trumps. I'm still waiting for this joke to end.
@WebnetJacob  @CNNPolitics  @CNN  @jennagiesta  There are no better pictures
@CNNPolitics  @CNN  @jennagiesta  and that's all I have to say.
@CNNPolitics  @CNN  @jennagiesta  If Mr. Trump and maintain his lead; he will most likely be the next POTUS. Trump 2016! 
@CNNPolitics  @CNN  Hillary needs to bring up real issues to resolve for the American ppl.The only candidate that is doing this is Trump
@CNNPolitics  @CNN  As a Latina woman I am really scared of Trump becoming president.
@CNNPolitics  @CNN  @jennagiesta  If it came down to  @HillaryClinton  &  @realDonaldTrump  I'd choose his ego over her treason. #justsaying
@CNNPolitics  @jennagiesta  America Is finished no matter who gets elected.
@CNNPolitics  @CNN  @jennagiesta  The boob tube has won.
@CNNPolitics  @CNN  If CNN asked Trump real questions we would all see Trump for what he thinks he can be Dictator in chief.
@CNNPolitics  @CNN  @jennagiesta  He cannot be bought like ALL other politicians he will be a force to be reckoned with.
@CNNPolitics  @jennagiesta   Go get them Don
#Trump2016  @realDonaldTrump  now competitve in General #Election Polls  #Clinton 51% * #Trump 45%  @CNNPolitics  *
@CNNPolitics  @jennagiesta  Please give Mr Trump a break. He is bringing democracy to Politics. The political elite feels rattled. He'll win.

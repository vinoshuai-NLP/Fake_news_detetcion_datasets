a lot of people in a lot of races (including white) are lazy and some are not.
Brilliant.  Now, you'll be the first to bitch if Trump brings up something Hillary did last year. Since its "old news."
Why would anyone choose " lazy" people for forced labor? Not very smart. Which is it?
Trump would be near 50 in 1991. Beliefs and attitudes are firmly set at that age. It would be foolish to believe Trump has matured.
Smh.
yeah we got lazy after we stopped working for free, funny thing 23&me didn't find that gene when they tested my DNA
dang where are those trolls demanding evidence that he's racist?
"N*ggers",“super predators” who must be “brought to heel was said by Hillary how come no one call her a racist?!
@LibyaLiberty  I guess I just learned I'm black.
@LoordyMarie  @realDonaldTrump  is a clear & present danger to our national security and interest.
for as long as the stereotypes are there. The problem of racism shall exist. Education and understanding are powerful resources.
when those stereotypes become debilitating then that's an issue.
honestly what more does he have to say or do for ppl 2 wake up to the NPD nitemare that is trump...duck n cover?
on your way to zero minority votes gutter boy trump
"Objection, Your Honor; Hearsay."  "Sustained."

old Drumpf family motto: Der Schwarzer Lazy Ist, but We're not Racists #MakeDonaldDrumpfAgain

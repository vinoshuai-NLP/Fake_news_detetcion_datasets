Just curious, why would labor unions support TPP?
@redrabbitsnpow2  @HillaryClinton  @thehill    Bizarre labor union support of TPP tells you something about betrayal of leadership.
Support of TPP is my litmus test. You support it and I don't WILL NOT SUPPORT YOU. #NeverHillary
Should say anti-free-for-all-trade, not anti-free-trade deal. He's for #FairTrade
Hopefully working people realize TPP will put Americans in competition with Vietnam's avg pay~$150/month
I believe he had to. FDR endorsed Al Smith before the contested convention
@RoseAnnDeMoro  @HillaryClinton  @thehill  more clearly, union leadership.

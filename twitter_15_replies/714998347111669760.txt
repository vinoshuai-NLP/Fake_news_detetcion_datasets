@BernieSanders  4 Reasons------Dr King would Oppose Hillary Clinton  Videos http://s1.zetaboards.com/Express_Yourself/topic/5967897/1/â€¦
@BernieSanders  FINALLY
@drewgrimaldi  @BernieSanders  Why do you feel it is a joke?
@BernieSanders  If only people actually read these days
@BernieSanders  So basically this is all due to everyone else...no element for personal responsibility of one's family & community?
@omairsheikh5  @mrmrsnever  @BernieSanders  Hey man, it's just a profile pic.
@BernieSanders  How did Pittsburgh go Bernie?
@omairsheikh5  @mrmrsnever  @BernieSanders  lol. I know.
@BernieSanders  - As an AA HRC supporter I want to thank you for coming up with a comprehensive plan to deal with these challenges. Good job
@omairsheikh5  I don't complain about discrimination. I complain about false accusations of racism and lies.
@BernieSanders  you are my hero  Mr.Sanders and Hillary is my She-hero!
@drewgrimaldi  And how would they hurt them, and why do you view it as "hurt"?
@BernieSanders  Not you Bernie! Why? As a minority I can tell you institutional racism does not exist! Stop holding my ppl back!
@BernieSanders  #HillaryClinton #imwithher
@BernieSanders  then what do you have to say about #bonitatindle?
@BernieSanders  Four simple words: I believe in you.
@drewgrimaldi  @Kazzaino  i agree.
@CK557755 How so what?
@BernieSanders  Bernie....Bernie show us a law that is still relevant today that discriminates against people of color.
@BernieSanders  is it racism or culturism?
@drewgrimaldi  That just makes it sound like you are enamored with greed.  Do you have a more logic based explanation?  Yours is emotional.
@drewgrimaldi  @Kazzaino  you answer just like trump. No answer at all just word jumble. Smh
@Eric_the_bench  @drewgrimaldi  @Kazzaino  Make America GRUNT again!
@BernieSanders  you still tryin tofool people.
@drewgrimaldi  I know its hard because twitter is for kids that cant pay attention to more than 140 chars, type it in notepad, take a pic.
@drewgrimaldi  You state you're a comedian, i picked you to reply to because im hoping you can form a logical response that takes all sides.
@drewgrimaldi  @Kazzaino  i think this guy Bernie,full of shit.
@Lamontrivers7  @drewgrimaldi  What does "full of shit" mean as far as his proposals vs your preferred candidate.
@BernieSanders  I can think of a program that discriminates men on the basis of gender Affirmative Action
@drewgrimaldi  This is why I say type it in notepad, it is not rational to equate serfdom to bernies policies.  u fear the word "socialism"
@Kazzaino  @drewgrimaldi  you should offer a solution to people that you speak in case they need to puke
@drewgrimaldi  go google what his actual policies are, and point out how you feel they are harmful rather than helpful.
@Kazzaino  @drewgrimaldi  I followed the link & read all his 'policies'; huge list of stuff other people should do, no 'as President I'll do'.

@TelegraphNews  All I can say is WOW
@TelegraphNews  @MGR16  Bowie changed the music scene about five times. Spanning over 40 years. R.I.P.
@TelegraphNews  Did you really have to have the "buy David Bowie's new album" links in there? Fuck's sake.
@Jonic  @TelegraphNews  Why do news reporters double talk as if like Max headroom in tweets or is it just to make the sentence up!
@TelegraphNews  #fascinating and a little #scary
@TelegraphNews  RIP Mr. David Bowie
@TelegraphNews  one thing - in the article he is applying his Aladdin same make-up, not Ziggy

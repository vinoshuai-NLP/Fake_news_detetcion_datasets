@espn  future Laker
@espn  @flinn_boston
@espn  not a big basketball fan but I can read and those numbers aren't mirrored
. @espn  again, Henry Ellenson just played and had 32 and 10. Simmons isn't the only talented freshman.
@espn  and he's a SF. The Celtics have the Nets pick which is projected for 3rd. The future is bright.
@espn  hope he at least gets "compensated" like Shaq too!
@Dumb_Ina_Can  @espn  You refer to a college freshman as "trash"? Maybe you don't like his game but "trash"? REALLY?
@xQuickSilva  right, he's obviously super good. Just annoying that  @espn  only talks about him. Other good players in the NCAA
@espn  his teams 13-7 overall. Get to the tourney then we can talk numbers.
@espn  Buddy Hield better
@espn  man...can't believe he's the only one playing...against a #1 team
@espn  Simmons definite number one draft pick
@espn  is he projected as a power forward or more of a small forward in the  @NBA ?

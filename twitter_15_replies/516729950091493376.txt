@lindenashby  say ciao italia?pls
@lindenashby  wow... Just wow. 
@lindenashby  NO JUSTICE!  THIS IS BULLSHIT
@JasiShay  Police Poll:Should law enforcement be allowed to use their badge and gun during personal time? Vote here http://copsunderground.com/press
@lindenashby  There could be twenty sides to the story, but that. is. not. okay.
@lindenashby  I agree.
@lindenashby  devil's advocate: maybe she was a Wendigo....
@lindenashby  @neontaster  good news for her she saves money on psychiatrists!!!! 
@lindenashby  @CalebHowe  Well, yeah...one side is an innocent woman is dead, and the other side is evil walks the earth.
@lindenashby  please follow me!!
@lindenashby  Only knee-jerk idiots cld accept her saying there's two sides. Lack of logic is becoming de rigeur in U.S. It's frightening
@lindenashby  @CaroleGilman  She sounds like a doozey. Apple might not have fallen far from the tree.
@lindenashby  One side would be:Nolen was given a 2nd chance at success after prison; instead obsessed w/Islam and murdered in cold blood.
@lindenashby  yeah, that one is a wee bit difficult to argue with the "he had a bad day" defense.
@lindenashby  Yes, let's hear the woman's side!! It's only fair!
@MedeusaAKeko  @lindenashby  NO, that was perfect. Did she need proof that her son is devil spawn. Did she want to see the head?
@lindenashby  *I'm not very good at sarcasm*
@lindenashby  not only that but she wants to see justice prevail

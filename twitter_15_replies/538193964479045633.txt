@Razarumi  Misleading tweet. According to the news report, she 'helped' kill 25; there were policemen on her side too.

“ @Razarumi : Afghan woman kills 25 #Taliban militants after son shot dead http://on.rt.com/q5zml7  #Bravo  v   @sydrza ”
@Razarumi  @sydrza   Little am i surprised at,not that she over-killed 24 times of her one son, but that it REVEALS MUSLIMS' MENTALITY TO KILL
@Razarumi  @sydrza   To  the islam,COUNTER-KILLING is an answer to a killing and it is celebrated by the Muslims! The Qur'an to be re-written
@Razarumi  @sydrza   Non-where in the history and present-time is  a killing is celebrated  more wildly than in the ISLAM
@Razarumi  @sydrza   DO demand the pro-elite publishers to publishmy research based non-fiction" IDEA OF INDIA, FUCKED" reveals Muslims'traits
@Razarumi  @sydrza  Great women but how did she know her son was killed by Taliban not western allies in Taliban uniform #Taliban #USA
@Harbwit  @Razarumi  seriously cannot imagine the circumstances these women are living under.

It is sad to see how America has declined in just 8 years. Looks like a bad dream. American prestige has wayned.

then why do you try and turn land you've never seen in Utah into national parks?
Or waffles. Just saying.
get out and explore!
national parks are the greatest american thing. I just spent 6 days in kings canyon and it was magnificent.
Instead of giving money to Iran, maybe National Parks should be FREE
Thanks for supporting our National Parks! This summer we visited Grand Canyon and Glacier~So proud to call them American!
Agree! People should visit our national more often. I always feel good whenever I spend time in the wilderness.
@Interior  @POTUS  you're kidding right? 40,000 homes under water and you're showing your vacay pics on Twitter? Classy.
So American that they are UN controlled. fkn fraudsters.
Sir you are a great President..
siempre se expresa en una forma inspiradora y profunda. Su administraci√≥n hace historia x una #americaverde
I'm sure there's  some  park  in Louisiana you can get too. Remember Bush and Katrina? Come on?????

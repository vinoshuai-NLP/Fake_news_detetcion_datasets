that  @nytimes  thinks tika sumpter is "little-known" says a lot more about the editorial staff than it does abt tika sumpter *shrugs*
@nytimes  Correction: How 1 little known actor became Obama while the other known actress became known to white people
@nytimes  @mwasa .    .  Pn.
@nytimes   I like this
@nytimes  sounds right, they started out as little known people!
@nytimes  @JamilahLemieux  Nothing little known about Tika Sumpter. She is  pretty big.
@nytimes  Lovely article.  But, terrible headline.  Tika Sumpter is not little known.  She's on one of the top-rated shows on OWN.
@nytimes  @deray  are the little known  ?
@nytimes  little known? By what standards?  Miss Sumpter has a long resume.  Check yo facts!
@nytimes  Michelle is suppose to be taller than the president!
@nytimes  little-known to who??? We all know [of] her well!
I know Tika from One Live to Life. She was also in Bessie. Played Bessie's lesbian girlfriend.  @nytimes  @deray
@nytimes  Maybe little known in the "main stream" blk cmty knows #TikaSumpter
@nytimes   they are now well known
@nytimes  was that a comment or question? Everyone has to start somewhere. And I'm sure somebody knows them.
@nytimes  I hope they have successful careers; but there's no way I'm going to watch an Obama movie unless Barack gets impeached in it.

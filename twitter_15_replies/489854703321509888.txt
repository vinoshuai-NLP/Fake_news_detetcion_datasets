@Independent  Now that's disturbing! http://rt.com/news/173672-malaysia-plane-crash-putin/…
@Independent  The added horror here will be if no-one does anything about it. If it was a Russian missile Putin will need to answer for it.
@Duke_Silverback  @Independent  Ukraine also owns this weapon system ...
@Independent  @MAS  #MalaysiaAirlines are an abomination how do fly civilian plane over conflict airspace? That's an act of terrorism
@Independent  @testpilotpete what a disaster!
@Independent  omg just imagine world as a peacefull place
@Independent   It is so very tragic and saddening that so many lives were lost, no matter whether they were American or Briton or neither.
@testpilotpete  @Independent  true
@Independent  why comment on the us citizen number? Are there lives worth more than other nations?
“ @Independent : 'Nine Britons, 23 US citizens and 80 children' feared dead after #some thing wrong with MH airlines..,,,definitely MH 370
@Independent   I bet each one blames the other, but my thoughts are the rebels/Russians may be in line as the  suspects.
@independent  Thanks   @hersimohammed .  @LarryMadow   This was tweeted earlier by MH
@Independent  a tragic day - my deepest condolences and thoughts go to the relatives and loved ones of the 295 people that perished today.
@Independent  *six british and 0 US Citizens and no known children yet...
@Independent  EUROPE, WAKE UP! PUTIN, FUCK OFF! http://youtu.be/stH1hN8JyBI
And what about the other 200-odd people? Toe-curling headline in the  @Independent  http://independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/malaysia-airlines-plane-crash-boeing-jet-carrying-295-people-crashes-in-ukraine-9612882.html…
@Independent   Just featured you on my site ---> #RebelMouse xo http://rbl.ms/1ngRwSO

@freakonomics  Hey  @taxford  Boom!
@whereisjoemerch  I don't disagree, I just think your approach to pennies is a bit heavy-handed.
. @freakonomics  I think  @JoelHeyman  will definitely appreciate this.
@justamiddleman  @freakonomics  *disgruntled disagreement.
@freakonomics  Hahahahahahahahaha....
@freakonomics  that's just good marketing
@freakonomics  sure, but plastic pennies won't work in those penny squishing machines in tourist traps.
@freakonomics  It's good marketing only if enough people are stupid enough to fall for it.
@tmosley4  @freakonomics  the debasement of currencies is a sickeningly bad pun that has made a few high-end speculators wealthier nonetheless

“ @Independent :Lego letter from the 1970s still offers a powerful message http://ind.pn/11oVYG1" @neha_aks  @alok_bhatt
@Independent  Can't see my little lad wanting to assemble this!!
@Independent  @queenofthestow  pity Lego is slowly becoming very gendered.
@Independent  @mambo_ZW  I think Minecraft gives same opportunities, now, as Lego...electronically
@ambatrud  @Independent  it's such a good message! Encourages creativity without emphasis on what's "typically" for boys/girls.
@Independent  clearly fake. Employ someone to fact check yo.
@4DC5  @Independent  Ahhhh!  I thought it was a bit to be good to be true to be recommended that spaceships were appropriate toys for girls!
@4DC5  @Independent  Girls go get a spaceship to play with - and boys - if you want to mess with mannequins - go for it! There. Authenticity!
@Independent  to many bis poke #expensive sets now not allowing children to use imagination.  @LEGO_Group
@Independent  so why the latest 'pink' lego for girls!?
@Independent  @lysdeschamps  le genre de message à faire passer à la manif pour tous ... Sans illusions
@Independent  pity they mainly sell kits now, to allow unimaginative re-creation of branded stuff
@Independent  and all that money parents, governments & schools have wasted on 'fad' or PC education programs is washed away..common sense!
@Independent  But Lego makes all into marketed kits and themes. Ni imagination needed.
@Independent  @EmanuelCrisian  I LOVE THIS. Xxx
@russandchips  it's brilliant isn't it. Love to the three of you x
. @Independent  @140elect  either way, if you step on those things you'd prefer death.
@Independent  I'd say the poor alignment in the text says it all. Doubt it's genuine.
@Independent  @Monkey79  AMEN! :) 40 years ago the Danes had this down. America... Catch up!

@mattgallowaycbc  @metromorning  Huh - even 40 years ago, companies couldn't be bothered to proofread. Thought that was a new(ish) phenomenon.
@mattgallowaycbc  @TaraEWilkins cool real beans
@mattgallowaycbc  @Anniekidder  If it's real, why so many gender based Lego sets & why so many kits instead of regular blocks as in the past?
@mattgallowaycbc  Nice!  My dad bought my 1st #Lego set in the 80s...a hospital!  Had an ambulance, doctors, patients, etc.  It was awesome!
@mattgallowaycbc   But if houses like  @LEGO_Group  Friends are full of pink/purple bricks and only in girls' aisle, then excluding some boys.

@mattgallowaycbc  @reidshistory  If creativity is the goal, why is Lego so frequently sold in kits?
@mwspoonsmw  @mattgallowaycbc  agreed.  Nothing better than a giant tub of random Lego.

@piersmorgan  evil never wins
@piersmorgan  Yes Yes Yes. Hope it is serious.
@piersmorgan  get em
@piersmorgan  hardly got him if he's still alive
@piersmorgan  wounded is a big FAIL #killthebastard
@piersmorgan  I sincerely hope this is true :)
@piersmorgan  they want to let him bleed to death xx
@piersmorgan  yh fuck off mate like you even know its him, bullshit as usual
@piersmorgan  We've only "got him" if he's dead, tbh.
@piersmorgan  how bad, he could just have a splinter in his finger FFS, nothing story.
@piersmorgan  @ChelseaTalkJohn ever hear of "feel good propaganda" ?
@piersmorgan  plenty more nutters to take his place, unfortunately
@piersmorgan  boom.
@piersmorgan  good now go hang him
@piersmorgan  The headline is a little misleading, no? It suggests he's either dead or captured, lets hope his arms have been blown off!!
@piersmorgan  should have took him out
@piersmorgan  Glad we got that son of a bitch.Hope he suffers in hell!!!!
@piersmorgan  do they don't actually know who he is but they know he is injured. So basically a fake story
@piersmorgan  Fatally wounded would have been a better outcome for all. Heinous individual.
@piersmorgan  I hope he recovers, so they can bomb the bastard again.
@piersmorgan  Doubt the authenticity of this news. With minimal access to war zones for journalists it's hard to believe.
@piersmorgan  "reportedly injured" means nothing...
@piersmorgan  I wanted him caught alive and left in a room with the family's of the deceased, but hey that's just me
@piersmorgan  catch and torture the bastard! Wounds heal!
@piersmorgan  an injury? Geez weâ€™ll report on anything now. Is there a chance it was a stubbed toe?
@piersmorgan  il believe it when I see him in a british court than hearsay in a national paper
We'll see /  @piersmorgan  ISIS executioner Jihadi John reportedly wounded in air strike. Big scoop in tomorrow's MoS >
@piersmorgan  @Callys_Disco  Shit offer from M&S that, what's the big deal?
@nick_seward  @piersmorgan  you should everything you read in every paper
@IanLeigh  @ChelseaTalkJohn Spot on
@piersmorgan  hung from tower bridge would be a better headline #ISIS
@piersmorgan  hope he's alive bring him to Bolton and I'll kill him myself
@piersmorgan  do we know it him, in fact do we actually know what he looks like?
@piersmorgan  Never thought I would see this about a other human being BUT wounded is not good enough.
@piersmorgan  Monster! Nemesis always catches up with them. He'll rot to death.
@piersmorgan  @ShowbizSecrets  I bloody hope so, murdering monster
@piersmorgan  too bad he wasn't killed

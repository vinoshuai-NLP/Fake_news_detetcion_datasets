@businessinsider  @cooper_m  Otterbox it Doh!
@businessinsider  such a deceptive headline. All phones this size bend or break.
@businessinsider  So, who the Hell wants to try and bend it?
how tight are your pants? “ @businessinsider : iPhone 6 Plus really does have a bending problem http://read.bi/ZcmnGG ”
@adamroney  @businessinsider  the real problem here is the stupidity of people who think it'll be ok to sit on!
@businessinsider  @cooper_m  1st world at that.
@businessinsider  stupid not to have it in a case anyway.
@businessinsider  Maybe its a new flexible feature
@businessinsider  my iPhone 6 has not bent yet but it is aluminum and bound to if it is put under lots of pressure.
“ @businessinsider : The iPhone 6 Plus really does have a bending problem http://read.bi/ZcmnGG ”   oh shit 
@businessinsider  How boney is your ass that you would need it to bend like acrobat.

@samanthasablan  @maddisonfortuna  Steve jobs didn't die for you to get a samsung
@businessinsider  I heard it has a chainsawing problem too. Damn you Jony and your Aluminum.

  RT  @TIME : Americaâ€™s biggest toy company is changing the most famous body in the world http://ti.me/20viQ0a
@TIME  Do we really want a pot bellied #Barbie?
@TIME   Hey! It's just a doll stupid, a toy, not a real body! #Barbie #doll #toy #Mattel #GIJoe #actionfigures #lego
@TIME  well this is Barbie after her first baby.  But kudos to #Mattel !
@TIME  Nope still missing morbidly obese Barby.
@TIME    Ya se dieron cuenta que no todo mundo es rubio, de ojos azules, de buen cuerpo y lindo. Habemos de todo, eso se llama diversidad!!
@TIME  @Mattel  It was patterned after a Dutch female. That look, though now partially American, is of Dutch origin.
@TIME  @Mattel  Using a public example, think of #DorisDay, She was Dutch.
@TIME  @Mattel  @CBSNews  @NBCNightlyNews  While its just a Doll, your continued query fuels negativity toward the Dutch. Americans are ignorant
@TIME  @Mattel  @CBSNews  @NBCNightlyNews  toward her original look. Some writing that they were tired of seeing the doll further commenting
@TIME  @KarenFox29  ...Why do dolls have to come with a shape?  What is next transvestite dolls? We are taking toys to a unnecessary level
@TIME  @heyatikah she's still not a person of color. Says everything I need to know about America beauty
@heyatikah  @TIME  they had different names and weren't marketed as barbie. I refuse to buy my nieces dolls that don't look like them.
@iamDrWill  @heyatikah  @TIME  I thought they were coming out with several new dolls, including (only) one black one? If not, that's awful!
@TIME  people can by so crazy
@TIME  Get the best quality marijuana and cannabis oil, edibles from this dispensary... http://medicalweedonline.net. order Now
@TIME  finally getting real #barbie #new body

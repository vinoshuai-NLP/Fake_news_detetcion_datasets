Restricting air space only at certain altitude makes no sense. It's either open or closed. Kiev regime is grasping at straws.  @WSJ
@WSJ  @Wittessay  Godspeed
@WSJ  rip
@WSJ  No excuses, simply a war crime !
@JodyRuppert  @WSJ  More than a 'tragedy', a major war crime.
@WSJ  damn
@WSJ  come cazzo è possibile avvenga una cosa del genere? si poteva evitare

@MusashiGonzo  @WSJ  @EconReTweets  the same people who can't find their planes
@MusashiGonzo  @WSJ  @EconReTweets  maybe because it's a long flight and there are multiple issues to coordinate? It's an airlines' decision

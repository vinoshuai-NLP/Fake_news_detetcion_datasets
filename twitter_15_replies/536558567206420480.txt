@Independent  @sigurbjornl  Yet, so sadly, finding a generic lego set is so difficult. Not to mention things like Meccano.

@Independent  I hated Lego. And really hated Meccano. Sceletrix all day, every day 
@Independent  @LetToysBeToys  have u seen this??
@soundwords  Who knows! But I like the sentiment. :-)
@Independent  Fairly sure this is fake, it's full of typos & grammatical errors for a start.
@Independent  @MiltonBroome  it's a great letter - the fact that we still feel the need to tweet about it 40 years later... not so much!
@Independent  @stonedrew  love this

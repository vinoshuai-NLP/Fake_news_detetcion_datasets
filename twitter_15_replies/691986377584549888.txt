@cnnbrk  the innocents are the ones who pay the high price.
@aryakamrani  @anantucketlady  @cnnbrk  More than a few.Not seeing a public Muslim community outpouring of protest.Stop blaming the press.
@aryakamrani  @anantucketlady  @cnnbrk  Do u know how silly u sound?
@aryakamrani  @anantucketlady  @cnnbrk  U are in full court press of denial.
@aryakamrani  @chipnjaz  @cnnbrk  Excuse me. I am NOT a racist. I have worked, grown up with, been friends with all. Just tired of the whining
@aryakamrani  @chipnjaz  @cnnbrk  No one likes to hear of attacks on any group. They are feared. Just know someone before calling them names.
@aryakamrani  @chipnjaz  @cnnbrk  Thank you.
@aryakamrani  @anantucketlady  @cnnbrk  Arya,Because of an honest discussion & u don't agree with me you call me a hater? Pathetic behavior.
@cnnbrk  These people will fight each other. But won't join forces to fight and eliminate a despot. Freedom has to come from them. Not Us.
@cnnbrk  可怜的人，希望上天保佑不再有战争，愿天保佑正在挨饿的叙利亚人

@eonline  I could really understand how this could be a compelling issue.

@eonline  I thought we left Bruce & Caitlyn in 2015, apparently not
@eonline  now you're changing your mind??

@eonline  keep supporting Republican policies  @Caitlyn_Jenner .  I'm no longer watching  @IAmCait  your actions have consequences for many #done
@karinaayala95  @eonline  right

@CzarMarley  @eonline  bullcrap
@eonline  it's people (entertainers too) dying every day and y'all choose this as a story?
@supcarson  @eonline  yeah what he said is pretty shitty. me commenting on the fact that he's a joke to the trans community? not so much.
RT  @eonline  Caitlyn Jenner mourns the loss of Bruce: "Maybe he didn't deserve to be gone."

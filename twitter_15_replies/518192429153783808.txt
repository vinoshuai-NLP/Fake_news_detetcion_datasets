Amen! Let's be media missionaries! RT“ @JarridWilson : Atheists Are Mad At  @carrieunderwood . I Applaud Her. http://jarridwilson.com/atheists-carrie-song/…”
@JarridWilson  @Scripture_Truth  @carrieunderwood  I honestly doubt they care.
@JarridWilson  @Scripture_Truth  @carrieunderwood  God be Praised!!!!
@JarridWilson  the fact that "Christian" blogs are using this amazing song to start a false narrative is what's appalling to me.
@JarridWilson  @carrieunderwood  none of us are outraged. I traced it all back to an article in the Conservative Tribune. They made it up
@AtheismResource   @carrieunderwood  the fact this  @JarridWilson  guy doesn't care speaks volumes about what he's about.

. @JarridWilson  @carrieunderwood  No, we're not. We don't care.
@zachfromkansas  @JarridWilson  @carrieunderwood  I don't even know who she is
@JarridWilson  @carrieunderwood  why isn't j cash's catalog elvis? under fire from atheists, is it because flim flammer beck wouldn't dare
@JarridWilson   You are tarnishing the amazing song by spreading your made up bs. Shame on you.
@jarridwilson  Are you aware that your article about  @carrieunderwood  and atheists hating her song is complete fact-free?
Seriously, where are the hoards of angry atheists? All I see is certain Christians using the song to goad us.  @ucphoto  @JarridWilson
@JarridWilson  I haven't heard a single atheist upset over this song. Stop making things up!  @carrieunderwood

@TheOnion  I wish this was real.
Been there :" @TheOnion : Disney World Opens New Ordeal Kingdom For Family Meltdowns http://onion.com/1PQUma8 ‚Äù
@TheOnion   11 minutes ago Disney World Opens New Ordeal Kingdom For Family Meltdowns. So long overdue.
@TheOnion  Where was this place when I had an emotional reaction after my parents laughed at me cuz I kept spinning around on the #bumperboat
@TheOnion  A creation of H1B engineers who misunderstood the program specifications.
@TheOnion  "I tried explaining to kids," the Buddha continued with a smile "that 'not getting what you want' is indeed suffering"
@TheOnion  @djcap  so much to do @ Disney. "Meltdowns" happen. Need "nap times"
@TheOnion  $75 for a Disney Park ticket!!!!  I wish they were that cheap.
@TheOnion  Next to be shown will be the new side exit door for their current IT people and a new rear entrance for Indian H1B crud.

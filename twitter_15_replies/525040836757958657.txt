@CBCNews  ? are their guns armed or decorative? Would they have been able to protect themselves if they had seen something?
@CBCNews  The soldier who died today at the unknown soldier monument in Ottawa.The monument now has a name,Corp Nathan Cirillo.Prayers to all
@CBCNews  for the petty idiots, tape was there before
@CBCNews  Yellow tape in background is for construction barricades, not crime scene.
@CBCNews
@CBCNews  rest in peace brother
@bendelliott  @CBCNews  - not likely. Probably caution tape. I highly doubt they had ceremonial guard there AFTER today's incident.
@CBCNews  it was taken before  the shooting the tape was there because there was construction going on.    They were repairing it
@eskinator  Who are you and what do YOU mean?
@eskinator  I already did explain my tweet.
@CBCNews  @DamnitMaurie  so very sad!
@CBCNews  condoleance to famillies and friends
@CBCNews  ~ a moment in time we, as Canadians will always remember. God bless all those who protect us.
@CBCNews  My deepest heartfelt condolences go out to the family. Rest in Peace...
@CBCNews  Where is Canada? How did we get to this place and where are going to go from here?
@CBCNews  horrific event, that a person felt justified to take this young mans life, is  sad and a terrible day globally. #stopradicalization
@CBCNews  I don't think it's crime tape, I think it's caution tape because they were working on the memorial for Remembrance Day!
“ @CBCNews :  photo was taken at the National War Memorial, shortly before Nathan Cirillo was shot. ” #RIPNathan
@CBCNews  @TheAwakening15  This is our 9-11.
@CBCNews
@CBCNews  @CAGWSkeptic    Fake guns? Shouldn't they have real guns?
@CBCNews
@Renacus  @CBCNews  According to the news, their weapons are not loaded.
@CBCNews  @KatDanPiano  Watch the next brave soldier step up to take his place...
@CBCNews  I am still in shock... Unbelievable!  RIP Brave Soldier...
@CBCNews
@CBCNews  @GTMGQ  And a pity and tragedy it was.

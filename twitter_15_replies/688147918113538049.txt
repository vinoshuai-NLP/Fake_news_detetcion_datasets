@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews   @martian_munk  @6666913   Lmao 2 days ago, Blige was really trying to convince everyone how great Burkina Faso is
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Where is this place? Africa? Weird place for ISIS to attack, no-one knows anything about it.
@FPaulRevere  @BBCBreaking  Why isn't the world speaking up for & defending these poor people? I can't stand the hypocrisy. So much suffering.

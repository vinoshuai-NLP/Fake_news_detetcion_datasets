@cbcradio  @CBCNL  what happend to him did he get in a fire or something or get hurt or murderd
@cbcradio  I hate that I have to sit through an ad before hearing coverage. What a disgrace.
@cbcradio  listening and watching. Hope soldier is ok. #justdoingtheirjob
@cbcradio  It's unacceptable that you show the soldier's face like this. Just because you have the image doesn't mean you should broadcast it

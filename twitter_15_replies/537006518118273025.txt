@henhowarth  @davidbrogan7  Good for them! We did buy pink Lego for the girls but they often preferred the normal ones.
@Independent  if only they had kept it up...

@Independent  I first saw Lego about 58 years ago when visiting Germany. Took a long time to reach UK.
@Independent  love my parents for teaching me this- I played with barbers and even Lego technic
@Independent  @CampdenEdge  so true, in the right mind creativity has no differentiation
@Independent  totally agree with  @LEGO_Group  a 40year letter though should be instilled in everyone. Seems society has radically changed.
@Independent  I think it worked for me - I built spaceships that looked like dolls houses!

@realDonaldTrump  but.. @samsmithworld won  @BET  award last year #BestNewArtist #OscarsSoWhite 
@usweekly  Wish you could say the same thing about all the other award shows.
@usweekly  sounds like an open admission that #DonaldTrump is ok with exclusion and acknowledging that the #Oscars is not for people of color
@CerebralDiva  @usweekly   No they are for people of merit. You don't want an award given through force, not deserved. Then forever worthless.
@usweekly  INCORRECT try again Trump!
@usweekly  And blacks don't become members of the KKK either.
“ @sdmack :  @usweekly  And blacks don't become members of the KKK either.” Maybe if you're Stacey dash

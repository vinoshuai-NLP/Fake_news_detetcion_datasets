@BBCBreaking  why was her sentence increased. Should be walking free.
@BBCBreaking  she should be praised! That's justice not a crime!
@BBCBreaking   few years ago a mob stormed paediatricians house by mistake.. can't be allowed to just murder willy nilly! Can get it wrong!
@BBCBreaking  courts should hand out better sentences to paedophiles to prevent this
@BBCBreaking  It's sad that the justice system in this country seems dedicated to only really punishing those driven to desperate acts...
@BBCBreaking  that says so much about the Judge.  Maybe the Judge is a Paedophile themselves !
@BBCBreaking  Sounds like she denied those and other kids a full investigation by killing him.... Suppose he wasn't acting alone or was....
@BBCBreaking  yet the BBC's former employees and friends avoid jail #coverup
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  most probably the judges are paedophile themselves
@BBCBreaking  part of a paedo ring and could have led the police to other offenders, saving other kids in doing so? We'll never know now.....
@BBCBreaking   yay let's protect those who try to hurt us
@BBCBreaking  what a justice system
@OutTheEU  @BBCBreaking  they just have a more consistent moral compass
@BBCBreaking  So Stuart Hall was sentenced to 30 months & served half. This women gets far more - where is the justice in that? 
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  good. 7 years is still too lenient for murder. Doesn't matter what they've done, you can't murder people.
@J3Lyon  @BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  how did she even get it to Manslaughter?
@BBCBreaking  I guess now everyone knows the sexual preference of that judge
@BBCBreaking   Sad. She should get a reward.
@BBCBreaking  He would've probably received less time for his crimes...
@bbcbreaking  @bbcnews  So this is the famous English Rule of Law?
@Dreamphoria  @BBCBreaking  
@BBCBreaking  Lucky to get away with manslaughter.  Do the crime ....
@BBCBreaking  should give her a medal this country's to soft #dogooders
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Should be given an award, seen as most paedophiles get awards anyway...
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  23(years too short
@BBCBreaking  very sad news this girl has obviously been effected, where is the compassion and discretion??
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  isn't that just typical of the do gooder pc society we live in!Bring back the death penalty especially 4 #peadophiles
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  7 years not enough for murder.  Young people get 35 years using joint enterprise & they havnt done anything!!!
@BBCBreaking  that's so wrong she locked up. When y'all probably would've done the same. A pedophile really!!! #YOYSHOULDRELEASEHER
@BBCBreaking  The fact the paedo would have got sod all. The judges are in the same club. Typical of the sanity of judges. senile & corrupt
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  just want to say that what if it was child he abused,in my mind pedophiles get too many a lenient sentence only to
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  sorry I meant your child he abused,taking away a child's innocence is never acceptable and if it was dealt with
@BBCBreaking  Why?

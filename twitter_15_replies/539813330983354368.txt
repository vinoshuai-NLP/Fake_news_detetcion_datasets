@jackhealyNYT  @nytimes  It sounds like black on black crime  need to find these killers mom needs answers
@jackhealyNYT  @nytimes  #HANDSUPDONTSHOOT or torch/murder on your criminal looting & rioting spree because u are #LAWLESS thugs #FERGUSON
@jackhealyNYT  Rioters did it by accident I think!
@jackhealyNYT  WHY DID DEANDRE DIE? HE WAS SHOT&BURNED DURING RIOTS IN FERGUSON.HE WAS BLK.WHY DID WE NOT HEAR  @THIS ?HIS FAMILY NEEDS TO KNOW
@jackhealyNYT  @nytimes  Shooting someone in the head and lighting their car on fire isn't an "accident."
@jackhealyNYT  call cnn I'm sure sonny hostin would listen
“ @jackhealyNYT : found shot dead and burned in his car. What happened to Deandre Joshua: http://nytimes.com/2014/12/02/us/another-killing-in-ferguson-leaves-a-family-grappling-with-the-unknown.html?smprod=nytcore-iphone&smid=nytcore-iphone-share…” No conspiracy after all?
@jackhealyNYT  he shouldnt have been there. peaceful protest during the day if you want. night time is nothing but trouble.
@jackhealyNYT  @nytimes  There aren't any former New Orleans cops in Ferguson, are there? #henryglover
@jackhealyNYT  Been reading abt this! Hope #DeandreJoshua murder won't go unnoticed, aggressively investigated, culprit(s) brought 2 justice!

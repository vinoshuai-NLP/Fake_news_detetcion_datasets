@AmyMek    If the Daily Beast reporter and Stewart had been around in the 40's, they'd say the "they're people too!" crap about the Nazis.
@AmyMek  Great tweet! Definitely adding that to my  @RebelMouse  http://rbl.ms/1mjsZNu
@AmyMek  @dumbcons  Just another libtard jane fonda who pretend lives a life. Bla Bla Bla,    like anyone give a shit what she thinks. She sks
@AmyMek  who the F*** is Kristen Stewart????
@AmyMek   Please RT for those not understanding about the usurpation by politicians and bureaucrats... http://bit.ly/1vlkdC2
@AmyMek  does she think obama s so handsome too?
@AmyMek  @saynotoliberal  Just another actress living in her own little out of touch world.
@AmyMek  Another perfect example of a rich celebrity that really can't relate to normal people.
@AmyMek  Article quotes her out of context. Read the original. KS on her character in the movie: "Simple, but good. Detainees are ppl too"
@AmyMek  @alan_reese  Omg! Such idiots! So Un-American!
@sally_feschuk  @AmyMek  Yes!!!!
@Yvonne33333  @AmyMek  @PolitiBunny  There needs to be a way we can ship them all outta here. They are an embarrassment to all women.
@Yvonne33333  @AmyMek  @PolitiBunny  They sure do. The definition for stupid should have their pictures included.
@AmyMek  She's more than welcome to live in that part of the world.
@AmyMek  @PolitiBunny  Fortunately the Military fights for the rights of Hollywood idiots to say stupid shit also!!! You're welcome, Kristen!!
@AmyMek  I will be sure to miss all of your films  #Kristen...also ##BenAfflecks & #GwynethPaltrows if she ever makes another film. .
@AmyMek  @Time4SumAxShun  ... I guess I won't trouble myself with finding out who the hell that is...but I WOULD second your suggestion...
We need to avoid her  @AmyMek  Move! Get Out! Dumbass! Kristen Stewart Trashes our #Military, Defends 9/11 Terrorists http://bit.ly/1xHFAvp
@AmyMek  I wish these folks would stay out of politics.  KS is just another useful idiot from Hollywood.
@AmyMek  @winegirl73  She's just a typical Hollywood moron. Wish these loons would wake up to fact that nobody cares what they think.
@AmyMek  @TIB2016 she's an idiot. Completed 7-12 grade via "correspondence courses". I read that as 7th grade dropout. Not good actor either.
@AmyMek   KS=Delusional egotist believes empathizing with Barbarians will placate/appease them, ameliorate the clash of cultures & stop wars.
@MichaelMores1  @AmyMek  Agreed
@AmyMek  I think we all need to say  @_KrisJStewart  keep your legs up dear. Maybe her and Gwyneth can talk about career suicide at a party.
@MichaelMores1  @AmyMek  well the only way Kristen is getting movies is with her legs open anyway. But hey I guess she is working lmao.
@AmyMek  @MistralWinds  only shit heads can bad mouth our military
@AmyMek  @MistralWinds
@AmyMek  Just because I'm an 'old guy,' what the hell is a Kristen Stewart? Must be a boil on a warthog's butt.
@JacobBotzman  @AmyMek
@AmyMek  Remember though.  Her vampire boyfriend beheaded animals in the movies so it is ok in real life.  Her next movie "Slut I Syria".
@AmyMek  @ButchDicus  Kristen Stewart is a commie, nazi, pig, not fit to be on earth.
Stand in line RT  @443777 :  @AmyMek  @ButchDicus  Kristen Stewart is a commie, nazi, pig, not fit to be on earth.
@AmyMek  #KristenStewart  is a traitor and a huge idiot. Course most Hollywood Liberals are morons.
@AmyMek  @Just_a_Texan  She makes the mistaken assumption that we give a flying f what she thinks.  If she does actually think.
@AmyMek  funny that Kristen Stewart should call anyone "simple" considering who she is, not a real bright person herself
@VickieP7255  @AmyMek  You read a misquoted version, here is the real interview. http://thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/11/the-resurrection-of-kristen-stewart.htmlâ€¦

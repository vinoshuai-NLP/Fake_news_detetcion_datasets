@FrancisBoulle  this is an outrage. This man created my 2013 and 2014 calendar. I'm not living through 2015 with him behind bars. #nojustice
@FrancisBoulle  you....you know it's a fake website right?
@FrancisBoulle  @wpusta  @FWaqa  Is he really? Check this article from 2011 and the photo. http://dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2029564/Notting-Hill-Carnival-2011-Police-launch-dawn-raids-tip-rioters-cause-chaos.html…

@FrancisBoulle  @charley_harris  @wpusta  Looks like a #hoax to me - it mentions BBC, but there's no BBC story about #Banksy being arrested.
@FrancisBoulle  @wpusta  http://nationalreport.net is a hoax webpage
@FrancisBoulle  @wpusta  you lie like a hairy egg
@FrancisBoulle  fool
@FrancisBoulle  @wpusta  Hi francis, nice to see you back on twitter,  missed you. X

@vicenews  @Reuters  What the fuck are we even learning with this photograph? Yep, that's something that used to be a plane!
@vicenews  @Reuters  Is  @SimonOstrovsky   near this area to get coverage??
@iamseandavid  @vicenews  @Reuters  LMAO
@vicenews  @Reuters  see what happens when you support terrorists in Gaza? Terrorists all over think it's ok
“ @vicenews : First photo from the Malaysia Airlines crash via  @Reuters  http://bit.ly/1p0iH2N #MH17 ” fucking again???
@vicenews  @Reuters  they wish it would have just "disappeared"
@vicenews  @Reuters  @michellebetz  #MH17 how come there wasn't this much damage on 9/11 flight that crashed in VA?
@chris_mahan  @vicenews  @Reuters  First it crashed in PA not VA and it was not blown out of the sky like this one was.

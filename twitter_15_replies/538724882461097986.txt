@deray    Why? Because = Racist Oh, also  @ABC  Sucks! (I'm sure all knew)
@deray  @shar76  @ABC  - Cause they paid $500K (oh, and $500K in 'donations).
@deray  @ABC  so abc is silent on paying  blood money to killer cop Darren Wilson, but won't hesitate to bring on Rudy Giuliani?  Shameful
@deray  @lizzzbrown  @ABC  Darren Wilson is getting a BIG pay check for this. Darren Wilson is cashing in on ABC & shooting #FergusonDecision
@Natalie_Writer  @champa10  @deray  @lizzzbrown  @ABC  Can Alleged "Criminal Profit From Known Proceeds Attributed To His Very Acts Under Probe!"
@deray : Cn't believe  @ABC  paid him bc wdn't that amt of $$ allow George S 2 take off the kid gloves. Sounded like #DarrenWilson wrote the Qs
@AboudDandachi  @deray  @ABC  we are hearing up to $400k , no denial yet.
@dingalingy55  @AboudDandachi  @deray  @ABC  This is rather clever, watch the wording of denial, push up the amount then deny it as ludicrous.
@OldCaesarCole  @AboudDandachi  @deray  @ABC  give or take $100k ...
@deray  @Jbug33  @ABC   Brothers & Sisters lets Unite
@deray  @psddluva4evah  @ABC  'Cause they paid a murderer, that's why.
@deray  Did they?  i understood that none of the networks that discussed an interview with him were paying him??  Is it confirmed he got $$?
@deray  @ABC  Crickets?
@deray  @juliawb  It appears  @ABC  is acting as "old media" and that they only speak to "real journalists."
@aj_the_geek  @deray  @ABC  And real killers, I suppose.
@deray  @NLuvWitUOnly  @ABC  AND he lied!
@deray  @MaggieNikkel  @ABC  As they say, "Something smells rotten in Denmark".

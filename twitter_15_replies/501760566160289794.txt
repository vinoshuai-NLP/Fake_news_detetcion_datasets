@JoAnnaRadzwilla  @_esaliba  Is life really that cheap to you?  And no doubt the cops will love you for it
@_esaliba  Thanks 4 the good news.  Hopefully 156, another dbl, get arrested tonight. Sure, everyone want 2 have fun, but we have 2 live here
@JoAnnaRadzwilla  @My2Sintz  @asmb90 that include getting shot to death with 6 bullets ?
@_esaliba  Why is his shirt off
@_esaliba  there's no reason to protest at night and someone was shot yesterday. These people are acting like criminals
@_esaliba  brutal force #Egypt
@_esaliba  @elonjames  How convenient.
@_esaliba  @elonjames  wait the "authorities" lie? Paid to terrorize citizens of #Fergurson Control freaks- bullies w a badge
@_esaliba  how do u know 78 was the total arrests?
. @_esaliba  other day, police reported I think 7-8 arrested, but witnesses said it was a busload. I hope all these "surplus" people are ok!
@_esaliba  why does 'the authorities' feel like they have to lie?
@_esaliba  @goingprorogue  please explain why no one can trust the FPD  @GovJayNixon
@_esaliba  I don't follow you. I don't care and you're certainly not helping anything. Why am I seeing that 
@_esaliba  @Agent_Orange76 mmm hmmm. and read on about how many were from OUT OF TOWN #provocateurs agitators.
@Agent_Orange76  @_esaliba  well 1 in 4 were "out of town". so i guess 3 out of 4 were DHS.
@_esaliba  Anyone else surprised? SMH.
@_esaliba  people plz don't make it about peace it doesn't take violence to get the issue solved....
This CLEARLY has to be a troll, gtfoh* “@JoAnnaRadzwilla:  @_esaliba  The cops need to start shooting these rioters.....”
@_esaliba  Congrats on your 250★ tweet! http://favstar.fm/t/501760566160289794…
@JoAnnaRadzwilla  @_esaliba  you gotta be a dumb fuck.
@_esaliba  @JennaBPope   Yet another epic M$M failure to report what is really happening!
@_esaliba  @anastasiakeeley  If this is true then it means they are doing twice as good of a job as we thought and their not bragging about it
@_esaliba  @erotao  No wonder with MSNBC stirring the pot along with others, there is nothing peaceful about intentual chaos.
@_esaliba  you are blowing this out of proportion ! Where are your freedoms and Democratic values now  @FLOTUS
@_esaliba  @erotao   Just imagine the tranquility of Ferguson if Sharpton, Jackson and Obama would all hold their divisive tongues!
@_esaliba  this getting really stupid.
@_esaliba  over 20 were outoftown agitators.
@_esaliba  @DeityFree  the cop on the left. Does his best have "storm trooper" written on it? #Sturmtruppen
@JoAnnaRadzwilla @asmb90; AGREED! The Looting sd STOP. But what I DON'T hear fm ppl like U is what R UR solutions 2 the ROOT CAUSE???
@JoAnnaRadzwilla @asmb90; Ppl like U want 2 hold these folks 2 a DBL STD! They have LEGITIMATE GRIEVANCES THAT R BEING TOTALLY IGNORED!
“ @_esaliba : 78 were arrested overnight inFerguson,double #s reported byauthorities  AGAIN WRONG INFO 78 arrested STL COUNTY NOT FERGUSON UGH
@_esaliba  what about the 3 dead? I just watched a YouTube video and now I can't find it. Do you know about that?
@_esaliba  @mch7576   it would be great if this man and the others were interviewed  ... wonder why they decided to lie
@_esaliba  This is all about 'White Supremacy' moving across America.  It's the wave of the future.  The White Right resolution-Subjugation.
@_esaliba  @marstu67  WHICH 'authorities' ? So many different depts involved, and they don't all seem to be under Capt. Johnson's management.
@attilatheblond  @_esaliba  I think FPD the source for am report of 31 arrested.
@_esaliba  @marstu67  and only 4 actually live in the town. 18 were from out of state,
@DixieRazorback  @_esaliba  As many from New York as from Ferguson!

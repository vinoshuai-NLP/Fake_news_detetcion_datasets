@FoxNews  That's got to be the most insane thing I've heard today. Give it time, something crazier awaits us.
@FoxNews  And this means what to me?
@FoxNews  they really need to get a grip now.
Meanwhile, in Crazy Town... MT  @FoxNews : A Saudi cleric has declared that the building of snowmen as being anti-Islamic.
@FoxNews  Seems Muslims need to define their rules. Head decap ok? Kidnapping and selling children ok? Kill thy neighbor ok?
@FoxNews  And you can't take pictures of your family either because it captures their souls.
@FoxNews  lolololol
@FoxNews  Now they'll be going around town beheading snowmen.
“ @FoxNews : A Saudi cleric has declared that the building of snowmen as being anti-Islamic. http://fxn.ws/14QnOxx” Agreed.
@FoxNews  http://mosqueesfrance.free.fr/ahmeddeedat/Mohammed%20le%20plus%20grand.pdf?id=11…
@FoxNews  good let's build as many as we can
“ @FoxNews : A Saudi cleric declared the building of snowmen as being anti-Islamic. http://fxn.ws/14QnOxx” Will they be subject to beheading?
@FoxNews  his realy a mad man go to hell please.
Just can't make this stuff up!" @FoxNews :Saudi cleric declared that the building of snowmen as being anti-Islamic. http://fxn.ws/14QnOxx”
@FoxNews  we better stop making snowmen we wouldn't want to offend anyone
@FoxNews  Such a tolerant religion
@FoxNews   Do you wanna build a snowman? Come on let's go and play I never see you anymore come out the door, It's like you've gone away 
@4DawnMarie  @FoxNews  Dawn you are living dangerously LOL
@FoxNews  how about snow camels or goats? They won't know whether to be offended, take a ride, or make love.  #allaheatsblts
@FoxNews  Pray 4 lots of snow this winter!
@FoxNews  oh good God
@FoxNews  tear down a mosque build a snowman.
@FoxNews  That is because it doesn't snow in Saudi Arabia and he has never shared the enjoyment of building snow men with his kids.
@FoxNews   me and the kids made this one. hope it doesn't offend any one! If it does #tobad
@FoxNews  I predict a bill will be introduced by a Dem to classify the building of a snowman as both a hate-crime and gender discrimination
@FoxNews  The Saudi cleric is anti-everything that is not a part of the Muslim control! When are ppl ever going to get that? Dump PC crap!
@FoxNews  simple solution! That "cleric" should pray to Mohammad to make it stop snowing. Hard to believe that their Allah is tempting them.
@FoxNews  
@FoxNews  until we realize that this is a spiritual battle, we will continue to fail. This war will not be won by physical means. #moralunity
@FoxNews  Is he serious? There's no snow in Saudi Arabia!
Beyond parody really. “ @FoxNews : A Saudi cleric has declared that the building of snowmen as being anti-Islamic. http://fxn.ws/14QnOxx”
“ @FoxNews : A Saudi cleric has declared that the building of snowmen as being anti-Islamic. http://fxn.ws/14QnOxx”  #NotNews #FunnyThough
@FoxNews  Talk about sucking all the fun out of everything!!!
@FoxNews  Building a snow man today just for the hell of it.
@FoxNews  @stephdufc83  even if you give the snowman a beard and sandals and a set of worry beads
@IANFAGAN2  @FoxNews  
@FoxNews    Come on guys,  Can't we just.....everyone now.  Let it Go....Let it Go....Can't hold it back any more...
@FoxNews  and that is why I'm an atheist
@FoxNews  Tabloid news. Insanity.

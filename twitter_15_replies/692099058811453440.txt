@BBCBreaking  Why is this so?
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  one plus two is a better phone & half the price.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  because no-ones battery on their current one lasts long enough to order the new one.
@BBCBreaking  @kypros13  @BBCNews  wow I think Samsung are as popular now if not more
@FancyDressBash  @BBCBreaking  @kypros13  @BBCNews  nah. Apples profits still annihilate Samsung's. It's just they've made very slightly less

@Raymey1979  @BBCBreaking  good point, next year resolution when their charter is expired. I am not going to pay!
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  that's because they have stopped being revolutionary and visionary. Also, the 6S is buggy and sluggish
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  like it matters? Does it seriously affect anyone other than Apple and it's shareholders?
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Really guys, this is breaking news?

@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  too expensive for most people
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Who gives a shit??
@BBCBreaking  @BBCWorld  @BBCNews  that's because without good credit you can't get one.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  give me a compelling reason to buy a new one, and I might just upgrade.
@deaxemurderer  @BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  .............Too................
@Raymey1979  @BBCBreaking  I agree 100%. #FuckTheBBC
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  it's just the same phone over and over and over again. Can't wait till I pay mine off because I'm done with Apple.
Quick, shorten the cords. " @BBCBreaking : Apple reports slowest iPhone sales growth since product's 2007 launch http://bbc.in/1ShKMln‚Äù
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Because it's too big! 5s is the king.

@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Breaking News----Imagine
@BBCBreaking  The iPhone sold 74.8 million units though and showed continued year over year growth.  Is the BBC just looking for attention?
@PWGolfer  @Arrowsmiith  @BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  what is going on?  Jobs was the greatest inventor ever. Better than Edison. #sarcasm
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Samsung all the way

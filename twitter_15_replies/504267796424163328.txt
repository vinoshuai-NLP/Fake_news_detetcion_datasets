@Rebbe1971  @ChiefJustice8  @CNN  brutally kill black people to provoke fear is the message law enforcement is trying to send. It won't work!!
@Rebbe1971 he wasn't killed at close range. He was shot at over 11 times from a distance. That's not defense, that's a execution.
@Rebbe1971  @ChiefJustice8  @CNN  how many black are shot first, asked questions later?! Spare me the bullshit. No more excuses.
@Rebbe1971 shoot with with hands up multiple times based on eyewitnesses and what we have seen from autopsy.
@Rebbe1971  @ChiefJustice8  @CNN  so what? He was shot with his hands up from a distance. The cops story makes no sense either. #lies
@CNN  why is audio a game changer? Shots in car, pause as he exited, more shots! Nothing new!
@Rebbe1971  @ChiefJustice8  @CNN  MB's fate was a result of a criminal cop who shot an unarmed boy and a police department's cover up.
@Rebbe1971 are you crazy? There is no such protocol. You can shoot a fleeing suspect. You will be breaking the law genius. #educateyourself
@CNN  #ferguson #michaelbrown #big dummy - let's just loot our own neighborhood AGAIN & burn some mo shit up yo !
@CNN  maybe there will be more rioting so the blacks can completely wipe ferguson off the map, burn the city down that will make them smile
@Rebbe1971 as far as bad choices go the cop pulled him over for walking in the street, not what happen at the store. Get your facts right.
@Rebbe1971  @Shaunton_Davis  @CNN  u never bn assaulted by sum1 6'4 290lbs if u ain't dead u definitely severely beaten yet cop shot 6 times
@CNN   "ALLEGED" audio of shooting.  Fair and Unbiased  Aftermath video of background conversation???
@Rebbe1971 what the fact have revealed so far he was shot with his hands up. Eyewitness said MB was trying to surrender.
@Rebbe1971 Wilson said: MB beat him, ran away, taunted then charged him. It's a stupid story. No one would charge a cop with a loaded gun.
@CNN  Who cares! Enough already of this Michael Brown case. The kid gets more attention than our servicemen overseas in a frigin war!
@Rebbe1971 so for that he is shot to death? Shot a period? Get your life women.
@Rebbe1971 she knows her facts more than you do obviously.
@Rebbe1971 you can not shoot a person for running away. Period. Study the law. Stop suffering from white privilege.
@Rebbe1971 than you stupid. And same thing could happen too you. I could see you doing the same thing that criminal cop did.
@Rebbe1971 this is the US and not a 3rd world country. What you are talking about is commuting human right violations. You are a coward.
@Rebbe1971 your scarred to actually put a profile pic up or you just want to hide in the shadows of your ignorance?
@Rebbe1971 not really because I know black people are the most fear and the most admired. I'm not shocked my your twisted logic #Ferguson
@CNN  You cite 'a friend of Wilson' - is this the unverified 'Josie' sharing the account your own reporter disproved? https://twitter.com/RyanSloaneCNN/statuses/501075341256179714â€¦
@CNN  That audio is hilarious It sounds like the dude is on a sex line. Hard evidence what a joke
@CNN  s/b verifiable but #haters, deniers & #racists will find a way to diiscount it. dude better leave town/stay hidden
@CNN  @SuzyQ  How could Micheal Brown assault an armed officer if he was NOT armed with just his bare hands?
@CNN  the important point is police allowed to fire 10 bullets on cigar suspect? can a person hit by 6 bullet attack another to receve4 more

@afneil  Come on the Iraqi troops! I wish we ( the west ) would do more! Stand shoulder to shoulder with them and destroy this retarded evil.
@afneil  You seem to mock these airstrikes,  but how dastardly would the situation be without them ? #ISIS surely cannot be left unchecked.
@afneil  @CrannTarra  thank you SNP for voting against air strikes!
@afneil  interdiction bombing is ineffective against paramilitary forces. Close Air Support (CAS) missions supporting a counter-attack will.
@afneil  some definitions http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_interdiction… http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_air_support… 'Airstrikes' is a colloquialism. Many different types.
@afneil  ISIS paramilitary forces can melt away in face of interdiction bombing. But they will have to form up to fight a counter-attack.
@afneil  Not effective but it did give the decision makers a momentary feeling of Rambo-esk glee, the whole boys toys thing prevails
@afneil  Clausewitzian principles of war still apply: you need to decisively engage and destroy fielded forces of the enemy on battlefield
@afneil  but without gathering support from local Sunnis, the battle will just change from conventional to unconventional warfare.
@afneil  you're well informed... I don't see this reported anywhere else at this moment. What's your source?
@afneil  @ianpuddick  Didn't  @georgegalloway  tell you as much
@afneil  where did Saddams Rep Guard and army go to? Costa del Sol?
@afneil  @ianpuddick  NO BETTER MOMENT TO #LiarFlyer MPs of all parties. It's an illegal 'FRAUDULENT DEVICE OR CONTRIVANCE' Check election law
@afneil  When you've only got a hammer, every job's a nail. #iraqwar3
@afneil  and your solution is...?
@afneil  IS are hardened terrorist mercenary army trained by the best Spec Forces on the planet as a project that's gone seriously wrong.
@katherine1924  @afneil  the air strikes are to protect the oil.
@katherine1924  @afneil  The quicker the surrounding areas have Arab muslim boots on the ground allied with their aircraft we Westerners.. :-)
@afneil  Maybe its because their is no one on the ground to report who to target in airstrikes?  Mailiki's Iraqi army legged it.....
@afneil  And those who said they would join the Iraqi army to take on IS still haven't been engaged.
“ @afneil : Fierce fighting on the outskirts of Baghdad as ISIS Jihadists fight one mile from western city boundary. So much for airstrikes.”
@afneil  @Potomaker  Den Isis soll mal eine Richtige Bombe auf den Kopf fallen, dann sind die mit einem Schlag weg vom Fenster.

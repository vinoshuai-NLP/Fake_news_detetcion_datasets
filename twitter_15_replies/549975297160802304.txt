@abydosww Reminder, the bible was written by humans, but they probably didn't account to transgenders, transexuals, gays, lesbians, >
@PayeroJr oh god, you're getting cis all over the place.
@abydosww and bisexuals. So I don't know what else to say. Society isn't ready. Not everyone is tolerant. We try, but we fail.
@abydosww What about the parents? They're suppose to love their children unconditionally. I'd have to do the same if I had kids.
@abydosww Well, I'm not a total dick. So, #RIPLeelahAlcorn. There, I gave up my last fuck because I just found one. Again, I blame society.
@abydosww Well there you go, they were unworthy parents because they already broke the first commandment. Isn't that ironic?
@abydosww So am I accused of religious zealotry? I just know what I've been taught. At least I know what I am, and I don't give a fuck >
@abydosww What anyone else thinks. Our fallen comrade should have developed an iron will. It's very sad and unnecessary.
@abydosww Well, they need to die. She deserved to transcend into a better place. Her parents don't deserve that luxury. They lost that rite.
@mrskimyadawson  @EllenPage  @JoBarrow  @BuzzFeedNews  can I just add she didn't want to be a girl, she already was. I retweeted this and hope
@mrskimyadawson  @EllenPage  @JoBarrow  @BuzzFeedNews  Others do.So sad someone so young didn't see another way or have a chance #RIPLeelah
@mrskimyadawson  @EllenPage  @JoBarrow  @BuzzFeedNews  Oh and as for she should have waited balls to that, PPl need to stop assuming everyone is
@mrskimyadawson  @EllenPage  @JoBarrow  @BuzzFeedNews  Straight etc
@abydosww Until then they need to be dammed. I stand by my words. If parents can't understand the word acceptance then they're not parents.
@abydosww Unfortunately that didn't happen. Only the reversed did.

@mrskimyadawson  @EllenPage  @JoBarrow  @BuzzFeedNews  So incredibly sad & unnecessary. We really need to help people more!
@mrskimyadawson  @EllenPage  @JoBarrow  @BuzzFeedNews  Some are lucky to live through coming out as gay, but being transgender is way harder. :(

@cnnbrk  104 light years away X 6million miles per light year?  U do the math lol. Focus on the stuff we have going on in earth! Pointless 
RT  @cnnbrk : Astronomers say they have confirmed the existence of the galaxy's largest solar system.
@cnnbrk  And this is why I'm agnostic.
@cnnbrk  @PoliticalLine  Silly scientist, not need telescope to confirm existence of largest or smallest, by degree, existence is obvious.
@cnnbrk  Breaking: I confirm that within every galaxy there exists a largest solar system!!!!! (And a smallest!!!!)
@mccumber_sarah  “ @cnnbrk  Astronomers say they have confirmed the existence of the galaxy's largest solar system. http://cnn.it/1ROJkZ2.”
@cnnbrk  when they get a picture of it that's proof until then it's just theory
@cnnbrk  Any Earth there without a  @realDonaldTrump  ?? Please.
@cnnbrk   Earth is but a speck of sand in the  universe really, if you look at it on a grand scale, Our milky way galaxy is a baby.true Shit
@cnnbrk  so we won't get there
@cnnbrk  can we send Trump there ??
@cnnbrk  so far
@cnnbrk  ..Amazing, I love the implications.
@cnnbrk : "Astronomers say they have confirmed the existence of the galaxy's largest solar…" #1 in United States http://toprt.com/TopRT_US/?t=692537942439501824…
@cnnbrk  didn't anyone else notice that it's still just a theory, & they haven't actually seen this planet 9 yet?
@cnnbrk  The color tho *-*
@cnnbrk  so far...
@cnnbrk  this is thought was old news infact at the center of this galaxy and others is a red super giant star if not a even older one.
@cnnbrk  Within this galaxy is way more then we even know. we assume the size of our galaxy is the size of our known planets but its way more
@cnnbrk  if my memory right i want to say that at the center of most galaxies is actually more then even one but a large group of stars
@cnnbrk  this is inpart because of the types of gasses that are in that area that form stars or is a catalyst in the forming of stars.
@cnnbrk  However because a star exists does not mean that every star has a moon or a planet rotating it.
@cnnbrk  See, stars are not always at the center of everything! And space extends in all directions not a flat cookie cutter way fun fact.
@cnnbrk  Though i must admit this is interesting, not everything in space is in motion either and we should understand that just saying.
@cnnbrk  who cares. knowledge without wisdom. well, its like search the universe for something we take for granted here on earth. LIFE
@cnnbrk  would hate to see astronomers take a day to help look for HUMAN. because they are not Andy,  their heads are in the stars
@cnnbrk  and yours in up your ass, love the folks who live in outer space.
@cnnbrk  .GOD made it all! Still a lot astronomers don't know!
@cnnbrk  We are not alone.
@cnnbrk  Between Obama's ears?
@cnnbrk   Now I can relax

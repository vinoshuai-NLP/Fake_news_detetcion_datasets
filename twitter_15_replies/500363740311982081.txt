@ZerlinaMaxwell  @silkspectres  and that's exactly what thy wanted.
@ZerlinaMaxwell  What's so frustrating is that now we are talking about a robbery and not the fact that Brown tried to grab the officers gun
@dadwithswag  @ZerlinaMaxwell  Causing a riot and burning homes of YOUR OWN doesn't help. Less you SPEND is the BEST way to take out a enemy.
@ZerlinaMaxwell  Not surprising. #MichaelBrown
@dadwithswag And I said,What did you expect! This tactic has been done for decades. Take out the WALLET will give you better results.
@dadwithswag *Taken*
@ZerlinaMaxwell  @NerdPoetics  Murder of an unarmed kid, rather.
@ZerlinaMaxwell  Sadly, that was the intention. Misdirection. #Ferguson
@ZerlinaMaxwell  #THOMASJACKSONMUSTGO needs to #TRENDNOW http://twitlonger.com/show/n_1s4586k #FERGUSON Brown family says, #DEVIANT #OUTRAGED They're right
@ZerlinaMaxwell  a That was the whole point
@ZerlinaMaxwell  in 5 weeks no one will much care about all this
@ZerlinaMaxwell  I'm not talking abt the robbery. Reasonable people know that stealing cigars isn't justification 4 execution #DONTSHOOT
@ZerlinaMaxwell  @MikeKrupka Modus Operandi for these situations.. Smoke screen to distract from a murder..
@ZerlinaMaxwell  @khalil_fuller  that was the point.
@ZerlinaMaxwell  criminalizing black people, the most effective distraction tactic in American history... :(
@ZerlinaMaxwell  Brown assaulted an officer because he was worried about being identified from the robbery.
@ZerlinaMaxwell  @BJHare  Classic deflection and character assassination to cover up a crime. Until a court finds guilty, he's innocent!
@ZerlinaMaxwell  what is frustrating is that idiots think that black and white people can live together successfully  #ferguson

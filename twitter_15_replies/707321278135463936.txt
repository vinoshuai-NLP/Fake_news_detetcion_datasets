@meowwww_  @coslive  me
@coslive
@coslive  Honestly...who wouldn't?
@iammelsmith  @coslive  Exactly
@coslive  because he and Michelle already committed to attending SXSW, a pretty huge event. Her passing is unfortunate timing, that's all.
@coslive  @deray  I love our president.
@KateSpritz  @coslive  @deray  you're in idiot
@judywmiller  @coslive  @gardenofthegods  you'd be mad if he went.
@ArtistAdeem  @coslive  @deray  it was a joke. But yeah, probably not.
@coslive  such a disgrace and folks can't see it, send hillary your girl, such a POS, he the people's president, most would want him there.
@coslive  so his wifes going right
@coslive  @deray  his thoughts will trickle down
@coslive  he would drop everything if it was a. sharpston, j. jackson, so he sending who?
. @coslive
@gatesneko  @coslive  doesn't matter what she is, there some things a president just does, as potus i think anyone can understand if things
@cstodd72  @gatesneko  @coslive  So there is a precedent for POTUS attending the funerals of former first ladies?
@gatesneko  @coslive  happen, action speak louder than words & his have said enough.
@gatesneko  @coslive  lol, no just shows he has no class or respect, or decency. he's mad he can't come straight out with it.
@coslive  @Yay_Its_Sara  that's messed up
@coslive  @deray  it's okay, no one would want him there anyway. Heck, smart people don't want him at SXSW either.
@JessieJessup  @coslive  yeah- he has to keep at least ONE promise. #obamaPOS #transparency #obamalies  #you-can-keep-your-Doctor#phuck_obama
 RT  @coslive : President Obama to skip Nancy Reaganâ€™s funeral in order to attend South by Southwest:
@PrideOfLR  he's so real for that.
@coslive  @the_moviebob
@coslive  savage!
@coslive  @deray  Obama made plans to speak at #SXSW weeks ago
@coslive  HELLLLL YEAHHHHHH
@coslive  So. And?
@coslive  Misleading headline is misleading.

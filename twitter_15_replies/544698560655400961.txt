@CNN  seemed weird when that story first leaked. Still the young man will be successful!
Btw, Belfort is a fat, greasy little Jew dude... @CNN
@CNN  Wonder if that job offer at . @Bloomberg  still stands?

“ @CNN : The story of a 17-year-old stock whiz with a rumored net worth of $72 million quickly unraveled. http://cnn.it/16p36VR”. #shocking

@CNN  this makes the media look stupid

@CNN  media is a joke lol
@CNN  Stories like these makes you want to question the credibility of today's media

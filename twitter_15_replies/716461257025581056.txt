@Bernlennials  @BernieSanders  citation please
@Bernlennials  @BernieSanders  lol
@Bernlennials  @BernieSanders   Wasn't today just the district conventions -- isn't there still a NV state convention? Just asking.
@Bernlennials  @BernieSanders  He officially cheated and this one will backfire.
@DuehrWendy  @Bernlennials  @BernieSanders  how is this cheating. It's literally how it works lol
@Bernlennials  @BernieSanders   You kids are killin' me.
@Bernlennials  @BernieSanders  Rainbows don't exist in the real world. Refraction is a myth perpetuated by stupid, young Bernie supporters.
@Bernlennials  @tigs88  @BernieSanders  no he didn't. But facts, schmacts. Who cares.
@IamPhreedah  @Bernlennials  @BernieSanders  ok, he won the most delegates in the 2nd tier of the 3 tier caucus system operating in Nevada...
@Bernlennials  @BernieSanders  I like how you took an "insult" from Hillary Clinton and made it into something positive XD. Also, nice icon.
@Bernlennials  @BernieSanders  Nevada loves Bernie.
@Bernlennials  Real democracy means spontaneous conga lines!!!
@Bernlennials  @BernieSanders  He won, and im happy , but this shows how f'd up our election system is . Primary's are far too complicated
. @Bernlennials  You mean dirty tricks. Hillary won NV. So much for the clean campaign he promised. But stealing campaign data was dirty too.

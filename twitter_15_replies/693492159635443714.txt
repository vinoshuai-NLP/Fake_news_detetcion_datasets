@HuffingtonPost  @DeniseDresserG  Es un "mamón" este tipo! Dios nos libre!
@HuffingtonPost   RACIST JOKER
@HuffingtonPost  well, that will certainly keep world powers at the table - or in the war room... A real diplomat.
@HuffingtonPost  What if the media quit covering him? Then his reality show run would be over. #StopHateDumpTrump
@HuffingtonPost  That means we'll have to wait until he starts doing horrible things to confirm that he's a psychotic.
. @HuffingtonPost
@HuffingtonPost  thats just horrible
@HuffingtonPost   Playing games?  Another reason not to vote for him!
@HuffingtonPost  horrible person saying horrible shit is no accident
@huffingtonpost  Well whoevr this Trump kid is, i trust his school can move him 2 a special ed class where he'll get th attention needed
@HuffingtonPost   And DumB Mutgaf*ckers FALL 4 IT!!
@HuffingtonPost  He plays the media and modern editors are too stupid to realize it...Bunch of idiot TMZ reporters.
@HuffingtonPost  duh you media are complicit in helping oompah loompah spread his vile bigotry
@HuffingtonPost  and media keeps lapping it up #gullible
@HuffingtonPost  isn't that presidential????
@HuffingtonPost -Trump doesn't have to say horrible things to keep people interested! Many others remain interesting without being rude/mean!
@HuffingtonPost  oh give up you hacks
@HuffingtonPost  @JOD45  Sort of John McCrirrick with the whiskers on the top of his head?  @oldeworldewines
@HuffingtonPost   he says what he thinks, that's all you have in your brain. It is a decadent man horrible.  EU needs someone sane
@HuffingtonPost  @DeniseDresserG  ojo: Vicente Fox usó una estrategia similar y "ganó" le funcionará a este weon?
@HuffingtonPost  @ALeftistRedHead isn't that the same logic as a serial killer killing just to see his name in the paper ?????
@HuffingtonPost   NARCISSIST! And the media follows blindly along.
@HuffingtonPost  #wow what a jetk!!#
@HuffingtonPost  ..I meant what a #jerk
@HuffingtonPost  So presidential
@HuffingtonPost  I would venture a guess & say this is  @realDonaldTrump  tryin to walk back on some of the craziest doozies hes dropped so far
@HuffingtonPost  @realDonaldTrump  that is sad! Not fit for POTUS
@HuffingtonPost  Note to our readers: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully! #trump
@HuffingtonPost  that's what idiots do
@HuffingtonPost  #attentionwhore
@HuffingtonPost  Because otherwise, he's just not interesting. Obviously he knows it. Clowns are out of style. He should try intelligence.
@HuffingtonPost  It's because  @realDonaldTrump  understands that the media is no longer about TRUTH but only about entertainment and ratings.
@HuffingtonPost  get rid of him
@HuffingtonPost  which makes him childish… not mature enough for the presidency of the United States of America. H
@HuffingtonPost  While others say intelligent things to be interesting.

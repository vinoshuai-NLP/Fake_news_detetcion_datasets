@ffweekend  there is no defense for what Giuliani said. None.
@ffweekend  @LyndaG1963  That's okay. Remember when they closed those all Facebook accounts of those who criticized Bush...
Nope  @pmckanna  @ffweekend
@ffweekend  CJ should be the one used to mentor kids and teach basketball!!!!
@ffweekend  that's why no conservative should be on Facebook that suckerburg loves that commie president
@ffweekend  @Jesse_sDad This is wrong.
@ffweekend  CJ you are my Hero.  Great speach.  God bless you and continue being a voice for this Nation.
@ffweekend  @womanleader  What tha?!
@MiaAnstine  @ffweekend  I know......what's up with that?
@ffweekend  No reason to shut his FB page; he has right 2 express thoughts. Was there any graphic or vulgar language? rational expression- ok
@ffweekend  Wonder if he was talking pro Obama all would be fine! Sad days!
@ffweekend  CJ you are great, stand up for your rights, we are proud of you.
@ffweekend  Facebook shutdown after conservative defends Gov. G
@ffweekend  He is more informed & well spoken than many 50 yr olds. His parents should be very proud. 
@ffweekend  I am proud of you young man! Way to stand up and speak up. If you pray, ask God to save his soul.
@ffweekend  Fcbk may reunit old friends, but is a vehicle for all types of predators & people spend too much time & post too much prsnl info!
@ffweekend  CJ is an impressive young man! Shame on Facebook!
“ @ffweekend : 12-year-old CJ Pearson defends Giuliani's on Obama and his Facebook gets shut down! ” #NetNeutrality

Bolshevik plot RT  @camtemp :  @ffweekend  And so it begins. The end of Freedom of Speech on the Internet. Welcome to Communism.
@ffweekend  #CJPearson rocks! #WakeUpAmerica
@ffweekend  @fanaticraven  That is not only wrong, it is so mean! The kid is 12!
@ffweekend  I guess people that young with a brain and an opinion scare them.  Good for him!  Remember the constitution.!
@ffweekend  CJ is like the mini Ben Carson!! He says what he believes, and Loves his Country!!!  I would vote either one for President!!
@ffweekend  I got tossed from Facebook as well...IDC...i blocked facebook from ever contacting me again.... this young man is awesome.
@ffweekend  @Steven_Monty  Is anyone surprised? The twits at Facebook are big BozO and amnesty supporters

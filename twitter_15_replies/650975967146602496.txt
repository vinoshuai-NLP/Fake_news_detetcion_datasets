@robdelaney  *ENGLAND - the charge has been in place for some time in Wales and Scotland. FYI the streets did not run red.
@krisjacob89  @robdelaney  phew good job we don't have the 'right to bear arms'
@robdelaney  just another low blow for the autoerotic asphyxiation community. They love a bit of that.
@robdelaney  an improvement on the streets running orange with sainsburys bags!
@robdelaney  I'm just saying, it's cut down sharply on my American Beauty reenactments.
@robdelaney  @NeonCthulhu  & in Ireland...been doin it for years...c'est la bloody vie!
@jennymatt73  @robdelaney  really, my only issue is the government deciding what's good for me & coercing me to do it with financial penalties
@robdelaney  stop causing trouble! *winks
@robdelaney  Didn't work here in Dallas, Texas either!
@robdelaney  Look at Rob with his pence and quid! What next, litres and decimetres?
@robdelaney  Endurance is our middle name.  We'll revert to paper bags, then and ask for a refund on the plastic ones  #sorted
@robdelaney  I was so annoyed initially when they banned plastic bags in Austin, but it's surprisingly easy not to be a wasteful sack of crap
@fieldyfieldy  @robdelaney  unless you're poor
@robdelaney  look, any chance you have to be on the same side of a debate as Rob Ford, you take it. http://nationalpost.com/m/wp/blog.html?b=news.nationalpost.com//toronto/city-hall-puts-final-nail-in-the-coffin-of-five-cent-plastic-bag-fee-mayor-fordâ€¦
@robdelaney  Ontario, Canada is now a post-apocalyptic wasteland since the economic collapse that was precipitated by the grocery bag levies.
@robdelaney  @JimNorton  5p for a plastic bag? Ridiculous. How are they going to carry the knives they wanna turn in? #opieradio
@robdelaney  Hey Ron, I think you need to edit your last tweet. You typed "plastic bag charge" instead of "Rodney King incident". What a goof
@robdelaney  I opposed it so much, I moved to *gulp*... Riverside County! (They don't charge for plastic bags)
That's because nobody has any pence in California.  @robdelaney
Seriously, a high school classmate living there told us via FB it was working very well to save the planet. It's still here!  @robdelaney
@robdelaney  it's chaos here, send diapers!
@robdelaney  Don't forget that it also quit raining....water...it was raining blood for days...but water? No

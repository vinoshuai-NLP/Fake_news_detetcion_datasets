@HuffingtonPost  @gurorognevinje  Kanskje du skal kalle deg en veggis fortsatt, men spise kj√∏tt "i smug" #fakeveggie
@HuffingtonPost  That explains why they are so judgy of people who openly eat meat. They are really judging themselfs.

@HuffingtonPost  this article is stupid. If they ever eat meat, they are not vegetarian.
@HuffingtonPost  No vegetarian eats meat. If you eat meat or fish, you are not a vegetarian. Can't you see how stupid your post is? Seriously

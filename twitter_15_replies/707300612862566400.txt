@DailyCaller  What an Un-professional President in Obama.
@DailyCaller  such a douche
@DailyCaller  what a surprise!!!
@DailyCaller  Obama's lack of class would be too glaring at a Reagan memorial service....Like parking a Dodge K-Car in a Ferrari showroom
@DailyCaller  @EmilyMiller  he dose want see what a real  Presidential Library looks like
@RobertBilliam  @DailyCaller  lol
@DailyCaller  divider in chief. He's too stupid to realize this isn't about him. It's about respect
@DailyCaller  The longstanding traditions, the "fraternity of presidents", the respect of your elders that long ago paved your way..  #BROKEN
@rhondakelly0  #BLOCKED
@DailyCaller  Obama has no class.
@DailyCaller  how could anyone have voted for this piece of shit. He's dispicable. But then he didn't attend Scalia's funeral either
@DailyCaller  @DailyCaller  Maybe he has a phobia of funerals. Could be some deep seeded childhood memory....or not.
@DailyCaller  Obama has no class what-so-ever!
@DailyCaller  does this surprise anyone
@DailyCaller  this man has no class!!!!
@DailyCaller  @steve0423  DISGRACE !!!!!

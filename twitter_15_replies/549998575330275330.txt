@BuzzFeed  Terrible to see a young person take their own life.  Time for our society to realize "civil rights" might be the problem...
@BuzzFeed  At the cost of moral values, just to say "I can do anything without consequence" is causing far more pain than its worth.
@BuzzFeed  @JoBarrow  thank you for never once calling her Josh. She deserves to be the beautiful and inspiring Leelah she saw herself as.
@Jeremy_Sitzlar_  @CaitlinOlsen  @HollyFraser7  @BuzzFeed  Her sex was male, but her gender was female.

@frankiecense  @BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Yes, what's this "so-called Islamic State" all about?

@BBCBreaking     because we should trust ISIL--  Photo shows Jihadi John may not be gone.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Hey so-called BBC, just report the news, and let your licence payers decide whether they're Islamic or a State.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCWorld  Is this the Islamic State that has nothing to do with Islam?
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  they have their own magazine? Like Jihadi weekly. Blimey.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCWorld  of course it's "so-called Islamic state" ISIS do not hold the values of true Islam

@andybankertv  @FOX2now  Any chance that's being said for fear of retribution?
@lilfer1234  @FOX2now  possibly. He seemed frightened
@tomman191  @andybankertv  @FOX2now  Obviously? So he took off his socks in the 5m between the video and getting shot? https://pic.twitter.com/O8mE7LTuoc
@tomman191  @andybankertv  @FOX2now  And the store owner and the pictures say it wasn't. Why does someone who didn't see it matter?
@tomman191  @andybankertv  @FOX2now  you just repeated what you said in the last tweet, p sure my reply doesn't change
@tomman191  @andybankertv  @FOX2now  but you have two pictures of people with different clothes, and an eyewitness who says it wasn't him
@tomman191  @andybankertv  @FOX2now  but reasonable doubt? Innocent until proven guilt? Nah, fuck it, let's execute him
@tomman191  @andybankertv  @FOX2now  Good job getting (a guy who looks a bit like a) petty thief off the street (four hours after shooting him)
@tomman191  @andybankertv  @FOX2now  Hey everybody,  @tomman1  robbed a store. Can they shoot you down? Can I say that after they shoot you down?
@tomman191  @andybankertv  @FOX2now  Then what are you arguing?
@tomman191  @andybankertv  @FOX2now  So he took off his socks but did nothing else to change his appearance? Obliterated, lol
@tomman191  @andybankertv  @FOX2now  looooool. "snitches get stiches in the hood" (noracist bro)
@tomman191  @andybankertv  @FOX2now  You get the last word here, I can't argue with everyone forever. Peace.
@andybankertv  But Dorian Johnson already admitted they were in store and stole
@andybankertv  @FOX2now  This is getting stranger by the minute. Will we ever get to the truth?
Y'all --> " @andybankertv  Store owner told  @FOX2now  Monday that there was a theft, but said it was not MichaelBrown said it was someone else"
@PJ4MJJ   " @andybankertv  Store owner told  @FOX2now  Monday that there was a theft, but said it was not MichaelBrown; said it was someone else"
@ithl123  I could tell it wasn't him when I saw the video.  @andybankertv  @FOX2now
@andybankertv  @FOX2now  why did the store owner say it wasn't him and the friend admitted it was? Have the gotten an explanation
@animemoemoney it was a dumb tweet from a month and a half ago
@animemoemoney was there something with which i could help you

@MarlowNYC  read your interview.  I'm military.  No twisting her words. Kristen Stewart is insulting.
@srbryson  Huh? You might need a little help processing info then. She's talking about a character in a movie.
@MarlowNYC  can she sue for that? That's a huge leap they are taking
@MarlowNYC  amen!

@MarlowNYC  thanks for calling out  @FoxNews  , please set this woman  @KelliSerio &  @GossipCop  straight. They also twisted the interview.
@MarlowNYC  I hope that you will write a lovely little follow up article in regards to this matter. They effed your interview. So libelous.
@MarlowNYC  the terrorists and those who wish to harm others due to beliefs are not HUMANS! They are the scum of the earth!

@nalathekoala  @ndreajohnson  They voted in favor of ending contract with Detroit and pull water from Lake Huron not Flint River.
@nalathekoala  @stephennotsaint  @ndreajohnson  YES, to save $5 million, emergency manager went with untreated Flint River water.
@scchumpert  @nalathekoala  @stephennotsaint  I agree with everything you said. What I need to know is when #GovSnyder is getting punished?
@nytimes  i heard it was a decision made by the appointed emergency mgr.
@nytimes  they bring in these idiots who chop budgets without a clue about consequences...negligence is criminal
@nalathekoala  @stephennotsaint  Local gov't is not responsible. Snyder & his quest to save $ at the expense of public health is to blame.
@nalathekoala  @scchumpert  certainly many are involved
@stephennotsaint  @nalathekoala YES many are involved and every single one was hired by Snyder, not the local gov't, not the people.
@nalathekoala  @stephennotsaint  Would you slice off your children's feet to save money on shoes? There's no justification ...
@nalathekoala  @stephennotsaint  especially when part of the process was the treat polluted water. His family is not drinking this.
@nalathekoala  @scchumpert  geology/public health are matters for pros not penny pinching blowhards
@stephennotsaint  @nalathekoala And Snyder ignored the advice of the experts, even dismissed the findings of a public health expert.
@nalathekoala  @ndreajohnson  The alternative was to pull from Lake Huron, but a pipeline had to be built, so local gov't decided to ...
@nalathekoala  @scchumpert  gigantic ego prevents intelligent decisions .. closed minds are ignorant
@nalathekoala  @ndreajohnson  continue its contract with Detroit on a temp basis until the pipeline was built. Emergency manager said no.
@nalathekoala  @ndreajohnson  It was a leadership decision made dictatorial by Snyder, that led to the poisoning of a city of poor ppl.
@nalathekoala  @stephennotsaint  Yes we did.
@nalathekoala  @ndreajohnson  He did run the council and the mayor thru his emergency manager. Seriously, do you not get this?
@nalathekoala  @stephennotsaint  He was FORMER mayor and he made that statement before being notified of the problem.
@nalathekoala  @ndreajohnson  They voted before the EM was on board. EM dictated what to do with the water. You're still missing the point.
@nalathekoala  @stephennotsaint  Fine to reign it in, but understand and respect the people while you're at it. Snyder didn't.
@nalathekoala  @stephennotsaint  THE GOVERNOR KNEW! Why are you deliberately misunderstanding! He dismissed expert advice! Damn!
@nalathekoala  @scchumpert  waste and fraud arent the only reasons for financial failure.
@nalathekoala  @stephennotsaint  AND the governor made the decision NOT the local gov't!!
@nalathekoala  @scchumpert  choosing a political party to blame only clouds real problems and solutions
@nalathekoala  @ndreajohnson  CNN, MSNBC, NBC all news channels reporting takeover of govt is the root of the problem. Read, Google it.
@nalathekoala  @scchumpert  this is pure science...how many scientists you know are politicians?
@nalathekoala  @stephennotsaint  By the time the experts realized, the lead was already showing up in blood tests of children. Snyder notified
@nalathekoala  @scchumpert  politicians are bullies whose global space is contained in their own globe/skull
@nalathekoala  @stephennotsaint  And his first reaction was denial. Second was cover up. Third was pointing fingers.
@nalathekoala  @stephennotsaint  ONLY NOW is he acknowledging that he made a grave error and will fix it.
@nalathekoala  @stephennotsaint  OK, now you're being deliberately argumentative. We've moved on from who caused it, now trying to fix it.
@ToyEastes  @nytimes  yes, that may be even worse, destroy faster, doesn't mean lead wouldn't also do that.
@nalathekoala  @stephennotsaint  Since the rest of the world knows Snyder caused this, everyone is calling for him to be held accountable.
@nalathekoala  @scchumpert  we are wasting good money on good water ..lets get some of this bad h2o and hire more idiots
@nalathekoala  @stephennotsaint  Here. Learn before you tweet. http://cnn.com/2016/01/11/health/toxic-tap-water-flint-michigan/â€¦
@nalathekoala  @scchumpert  is it wasteful to tap a virtual fresh water ocean to drink? common sense
@nalathekoala  @stephennotsaint  YES, the city official at the time was the Emergency Manager.
@nalathekoala  @stephennotsaint  The mayor and council had no governing authority at that time.
@nalathekoala  @stephennotsaint  There's a debunked libertarian rhetoric emerging that suggests cities run by Democrats are horrible.
@nytimes  @Sylvaners  #Vote  now while you still have a chance!

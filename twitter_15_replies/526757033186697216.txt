@AlexLeonards1  @iowahawkblog  great article, but i have the posting form as early as July of 2014 http://jöntürk.com/asides/sok-fotm/asides/sok-fotograf-isid-ayn-el-arabda-kobani-ele-gecirdigi-ypglilerin-kellelerini-kesiyor-18/…
@iowahawkblog  May she RIP... and may her killers burn in Hell surrounded by lots and lots of pigs
@PolitiBunny  She was a hero, She believed in freedom & loved her fellow Kurds. May she RIP. Great role model for girls & women  @iowahawkblog
@iowahawkblog  @PolitiBunny  A true hero.
@iowahawkblog  Alas, beheading was probably the least of Rehana's punishments.
@iowahawkblog  @PolitiBunny  RIP brave warrior.
@iowahawkblog  @ThePoliticalHat  They need to name a well-armed drone after her to continue the work. Let operators compete for it.
@TexasTruBlu  Truly sad.  @iowahawkblog
@iowahawkblog  @MJonHarrell  I saw that this morning. I hope it's not true. But if it is, she should be Joan of Arc of #Kobane.
@juleslalaland  @iowahawkblog  @MJonHarrell  Not true.  Alive and well.  Look at pic...hairline is VERY different, and face/chin MUCH wider.
@iowahawkblog  she's fine https://twitter.com/RashadAbdlQader/status/526847424909041665…
Heart breaks for her, sad RT  @iowahawkblog : Female warrior Rehana-credited w/killing 100 ISIS-captured, beheaded #RIP http://blogs.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/timblair/index.php/dailytelegraph/comments/rehana/…
@iowahawkblog  @MissAlieNicole The #Kurds have refuted that News. #Rehana is alive & still kicking isis ass.
Hopefully Kurds have her live on camera soon as proof.  @indiacommoner  @MissAlieNicole  @iowahawkblog
@iowahawkblog  @MissAlieNicole God Bless her soul
@iowahawkblog  Learned last night this story was incorrect.  Rehana is alive in Turkey. A different brave young lady was murdered.

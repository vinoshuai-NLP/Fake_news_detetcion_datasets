@Reuters  Angela Merkel showed compassion when other EU leaders evaded responsibility...She deserves the 60% support
@Reuters  so the poll also shows that 60% wants her to stay
@Reuters  @patrickmadrid  I agree!
@Reuters  this will be Hillary next photo resigning from her run for the president make a deal with Obama to step aside they won't lock up
@Reuters  A really dubious poll and yet still only 40% want her to go? That's not bad at all considering...
@Reuters  @Gowersurfing so 60% don't?
@Reuters  so more dont than do.
@Reuters  That's very sad indeed. I wish there were 5 leader like her the world would have been different
So … 60% either don’t care or are comfortable with Merkel’s immigrant policy   @Reuters
@Reuters  too bad.  I think she made a very compassionate decision.
@Reuters .  When the Haves try to  defend their turf. #ughh
@Reuters  Probably more than that.Unfortunately,Germany does not have direct democracy like they do in Switzerland.She'll be hard to kick out
@Reuters  And from what I hear.......  the other 60% want her lynched
@Reuters  @ChurchSecurityI  ... Why are seeing so much off topic stuff?
@Reuters  @AusPublica  I can't believe there's not more

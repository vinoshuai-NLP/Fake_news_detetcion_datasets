@THESOURCE  @sousedbergin  So... she is a completely innocent bystander?  That sucks.
@UKTBL  @THESOURCE  No one is ever completely innocent, I'm sure they'll drum up something.
@THESOURCE  @TjatteHedlund  police are out of control.they kkknow they wont be arrested so they attackkk and kkkill without thinking

@THESOURCE  @RaniaKhalek  You go along with this, Mr Police Chief? Mr Mayor? Mr Non-Prosecutor D.A.? We have met the "other" and she is us.
@Swedensfuture tyst med dig!  @THESOURCE

TW “ @THESOURCE : A pregnant woman has lost her eye after being shot with bean bag by police in Ferguson: http://goo.gl/a9SfGM ”
@THESOURCE  I'm sorry but why would you go to a potentially violent protest of you're pregnant?
@THESOURCE  @Sonichu1  and why is a pregnant woman at a riot where people are firebombing buildings and looting?

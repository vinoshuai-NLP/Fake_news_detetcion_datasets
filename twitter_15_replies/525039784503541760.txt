@CBCOttawa
@CBCOttawa  @chrislhayes  The Muslim community has to speak out and loudly against radical hijack of Islam. Silence implies support.
@CBCOttawa  Deepest condolences to the family and friends of this brave soldier.  #OttawaShooting
@CBCOttawa  @chrislhayes  Wonder if their rifles were even loaded.
@gtcaz  @CBCOttawa  @chrislhayes  no. honour guards are for show
@CBCOttawa  This photo was taken on Oct 19th. Not minutes before. Get your facts right.
@CBCOttawa  Prayers going up for all in #Ottawa. #OttawaStrong  God Bless.
@CBCOttawa  @chrislhayes  Sorry, but I find this tweet to be in poor taste. Were this man a part of my family, I would find it cruel even.
@CBCOttawa  @chrislhayesy Sad in Canada murder today in Israel of Jewish baby not in Us/Intl news, our spilled blood is not headline worthy
@JDVFL  @CBCOttawa  nor will this make headlines in Israel, what's you point ?
@CBCOttawa  Was just there last summer! Chilling! #CanadaStrong #PrayForOttawa #Pray for #Ottawa
@CBCOttawa  very sad, senseless violence.
. @CBCOttawa  @CapitalSquirrel  I don't think his family needs you doing this
@bigpicguy  @CBCOttawa  If it was me, I would want to see my child portrayed doing something to which he had aspired. Do you find it ghoulish?
@CBCOttawa  @markc01  May  God give comfort from their grief to his family and may he rest in peace
@greenwoodls  @CBCOttawa  good question, not sure
@CBCOttawa  @TimWilliton  Words cannot express how sad this is, I'm heartbroken for him, his family. So, so awful.
@CBCOttawa  @acoyne  Who is the soldier on the right? I can't imagine how he's feeling.
@CBCOttawa  @acoyne   seeing this picture before his imminent shocking death, makes it so personal and real..so incredibly, intensely sad.. :(
@CBCOttawa  @chrislhayes  It's so awful. My sympathy to his family.
@Efakter  I read that the weapons are ceremonial with no ammo. I'm not positive if that is true or not  @CBCOttawa
@CBCOttawa  @tvljr1  thank you for sharing that pic. Love, your neighbor to the south.
@CBCOttawa  @PorchPhilosophy  God Bless him & his family. May he rest in peace. America mourns and stands with Canada. #Ottawa

@CBCOttawa  prayers sent
@CBCOttawa  @AmikaAlert I take it that the rifles were ceremonial only?
@CBCOttawa  @chrislhayes  I believe he has a 6 year old son

@AaronDriver5  It seems that those blue spots represent silicates which have oxygen as their constituent. Perhaps there's oxygen there!
@DiscoverMag  oh, cryovulcanism.  Got it.
@DiscoverMag  is there some Protosses?
@DiscoverMag  amazing pictures.

@DiscoverMag  #Ceres http://LakeCeres.com - upsurge of hot salty water at every perihelion - plus plumes - that will be the outcome
fascinating rays  @DiscoverMag  impact breccia & melts blend to an almost ultraviolet; evidencing interesting compounds in the impact ejecta
@DiscoverMag  must be microbial bio-marking artifacts in the rich vallum Id bet ;) sure that's how we began too lol
@Wodun001  thanks
@DiscoverMag  Prediction: the bright spots will prove to be giant gysers (white water reflecting bright light).
@DiscoverMag  Didn't need the Dawn spacecraft to tell me that. A couple of my friends are Cereans
@DiscoverMag  @AstroAmandaM  Stunning video!  Thank you for sharing!
@DiscoverMag  Yep. That's a spacerock.
@DiscoverMag  wow
looks like magmatic activity in preserved crater lakes  @DiscoverMag
@DiscoverMag  rough rocky ball
@DiscoverMag  @mathemaniac  The 'bright' spots prob just look that way. They're prob white, and look that way coz they are salty comet impacts
@DiscoverMag  am I the only one that sees vaults from borderlands?
@DiscoverMag  mesmerizing!

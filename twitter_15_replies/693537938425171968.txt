@nytimes  He has no plan, never will either. Also, look at the gut on him, he's not fit physically to be Potus or mentally.
@nytimes  as usual no answer is Cruz's answer. #RepublitardProblems
@nytimes  @tedcruz  should tell truth-he is only pro-life until birth after that you are on your own. Regulations don't kill people, GOP does.
@nytimes  Government regulations my ass.  Tell the truth about predatory/exclusionary insurance companies.
@nytimes  obliviously Cruz cannot relate to him in a personal way ,He is just not a people person. It ok not many people are, Trump is 
@nytimes  Instead of giving voters the representation they want,  @tedcruz  is looking for voters that want what he's selling. #badmarketing
@nytimes  This should really be a big concern to Americans.  Majority of this politicians don't tell the TRUTH. That's what sets people free.
@nytimes  never answered the question
@nytimes  Classic mistake RINOpublicans have made for YEARS! You need to have something that works or DemcoRATs give us this junk. DO IT.
@PeterPrunski  @nytimes  Canada or Cuba please take him back.
@nytimes  Obama nukes Hillary, admits server contained top U.S. secrets Read more at
@nytimes  Gotcha with the facts.
@MMitchTX  @nytimes  Except then you ignore those who can't afford worse coverage under ObamaCare. I guess they don't count?
@TheRealKlauss  @MMitchTX Not saying the ACA has been good for *everyone* but it has clearly helped a lot more people than it has hurt.
@nytimes  @tedcruz  is trying 2 have it both ways blaming govt  4 people not having ins & 4 making it 2 expensive when they do which is it?
@nytimes  @vanbadham  Exactly...Trump and Cruze et al have no ANSWERS! Only bile.
@nytimes  He never actually answered the guys question.These politicians are scam artists and what's worse is the people who believe them.
@nytimes  "Our party has been taken over by radicals and we have no viable plans to fix what we think is broken" New GOP slogan, a winner.
@MMitchTX  @EllisGreggs  Increase Medicare coverage 4 the poor and disabled and remove OC regulations that force costs up.
@TheRealKlauss  @MMitchTX Is this something Cruz and other Republicans would/are endorse/ing?
@nytimes  The man's a self-centered idiot. Ironically, when he was born, his parents paid nothing... Canadian universal health care
When Republicans talk about #ACA repeal, these are the families who would be hurt http://nyti.ms/1Ss63c5  @nytimes
@abwhite7  @RedwoodGirl  @nytimes  Cruz could care less about anybody except his own massive ego.
@nytimes  he promises he has a plan and he will talk about it later.
@nytimes  can't believe he went to Princeton and Harvard.on 2nd thought, believe it with all my heart #SoullessUniversities
@xeroscape  @nytimes  That is the one thing that always puzzles me  What happened to all that education??
@nytimes  Robin Hood had no answer? I'm sure he used his preacher voice and paused for 5 secs at each sentence(so annoying)
@nytimes   your running for president when you were born in Canada?
@nytimes  Ah!  Details, details.
@nytimes  loathsome
@nytimes  I am a small business owner who was denied ins. for a decade. Thanks to the ACA, I finally have ins. And at a reasonable cost.
@nytimes . You just have to listen to these guys to see how simple and criminally evasive they are. Criminally because they pimp the people!
@MMitchTX  @EllisGreggs  I wasn't going into full platforms, just Ellis's question.
@nytimes  @tedcruz  @BernieSanders  @realDonaldTrump  This response from Cruz is why people are sick and tired of the status quo. We reject you!
@nytimes  Answer the question Ted!

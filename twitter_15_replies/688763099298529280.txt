@BoingBoing  @wilw  why are they allowed to receive any supplies at all?
@BoingBoing  @wilw  Please learn the difference between criminals and terrorists.  That is all.  Thank you.
@BoingBoing  Disgusting. Why do they still have power/running water?
@MeaghanMurphyLA  @AntarianRani  @BoingBoing  If they just cut the power, those candy-asses would quickly abandon that outpost. #HighDesertCold
@BoingBoing  @wilw  They... They're still there? What?
@BoingBoing  @wilw  Only one of these is called terrorism. #RacismMustFall
@BoingBoing  @wilw  Imagine the reaction if Islamic terrorists came to the US, took over a forest, & started turning into a fortified outpost
@BoingBoing  @wilw  
@BoingBoing  @wilw  The cops shook hands respectfully w/ these yahoos who r threatening violence. I was at OWS & we got treated very different
@Mabrick  @BoingBoing  this has been driving me batty from day 1.
@BoingBoing  @wilw  Interesting how they keep claiming to be there on others behalf & then those people say they donâ€™t  want them there either
@BoingBoing  @wilw  Cause im tired of seeing it. The government should send in a group of seals to just get this over with...
@BoingBoing  @wilw  what a double standard. #vanillaisis #YallQaeda
@BoingBoing  @wilw  WHY IS NOBODY STOPPING THEM
@BoingBoing  @wilw  that's sad because there is only one planet earth, are they too dumb to know everything they do is relative?

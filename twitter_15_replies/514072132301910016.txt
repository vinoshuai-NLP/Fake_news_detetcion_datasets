@NYDailyNews  she does not need the third breast to be unattractive. Now she's grotesque
@NYDailyNews  @scrillakev  Damn she just couldn't look in the mirror and see her Face?
@NYDailyNews  Of Course She is from FL that's where all the Coconuts ARE trust me I didn't even have to read the article headline was enough
“ @NYDailyNews : A woman had surgery to add 3rd breast to make herself "unatttractive to men." http://nydn.us/1mBPzBi ”
@NYDailyNews  #jasmine tridevil the 3rd breast was not needed to make you unattractive to men, now your unattractive and a nut job
@NYDailyNews  @RicHDaWGz  does she want to make herself unattractive or does she want more attention?
@M_iz4_Mel  u kno, i misread that @ 1st.. shes a weirdo
@NYDailyNews  that's gotta be a violation of ethics for the doctor. Also, she missed out being cast in that Total Recall reboot.
@NYDailyNews  Total Recall LOL
@NotAllBhas  Ok, there's my WTF? moment for the day.  Suffice it to say quite a # of men will find her titillating just the same.  *rimshot*
@NYDailyNews  One's not enough and three's too many. Kind of like martini's.
@NYDailyNews  that's just stupid she wants extra attention.
@NYDailyNews  @NewsroomJim  She's the girl from Total Recall!
@Scoop_68  Schwarzenegger or Farrell?
@NYDailyNews  she didn't need the third tit, she was doing just fine with the mug.
@NotAllBhas  @VanguardVivian  I've been relying on my personality to be unattractive to men.
@NYDailyNews  @JDtheQUEEN  da fuq? Lol
@5foot_somethin  @NYDailyNews  creepy 
@NYDailyNews  @WhotsWot  shame on the doc who did this - he/she should have prescribed a psych referral instead..
@NewWestSandy  @NYDailyNews  yes
@NYDailyNews  @NewWestSandy  except for the fact that she puts on make up and dresses up. What a joke
@NokimboStanley  @NYDailyNews  I know.!! obviously a way to become "famous" was the real motivation
@EnblocGarand  @NYDailyNews  True;)  Infact even with two she could easily go un-noticeable!!
@NYDailyNews  Chesty, 1-2-3, chesty 1-2-3?!
@NYDailyNews  Was she gorgeous before?! Just be honest & say that you've invested $20k in the hopes of becoming a reality star. #3rdTitBlind
“ @NYDailyNews : A Florida woman had surgery to add a third breast to make herself "unatttractive to men." ” same

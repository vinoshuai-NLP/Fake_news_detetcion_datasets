@PolitiFact  Just got asked to "inform" someone about this - since he/she can't be bothered to inform self.
“ @PolitiFact : Claim #Obama used #shutdown to scuttle AmberAlerts reveals ignorance abt AmberAlerts http://bit.ly/19atfTD”  @amandacarpenter
@PolitiFact  @ron_fournier  Perhaps, but a smart administration wouldn't have put that notice on the site. I have no sympathy.
@PolitiFact  @ron_fournier  That's not the claim. The claim is that Obama is trying to scare people by appearing to shut down sites.
@ChasFlemming  @ron_fournier  "appearing to"?? Christ, even in the face of BALD-FACED LIES you guys will use anything you can get. Shameful.
RINO!!!! RT  @PolitiFact  A claim that #Obama used the #shutdown to scuttle the Amber Alert system reveals an ignorance about Amber Alerts.
@PolitiFact  dumb ass #tcot right wing fringe GOP idiots will say or do anything to Fuck this country, this president.
@PolitiFact  Thebn what was he doing when he shut it down?
@PolitiFact  @Clarketacular I'm really sick and tired of seeing more of this fake news finding traction; how stupid are these readers?
@emlynaddison I'm willing to bet there's a high probability that the people who believe this might also believe Obama is Kenyan
@DrKC4  @yvonison  @PolitiFact  @amandacarpenter  If no one is there to maintain the site how do you propose it remain "open"?
@JennS79  @DrKC4  @PolitiFact  @amandacarpenter  unicorns ;)
@PolitiFact  @lawscribe  Why care at all?? Maybe the little scamps wandered off to look for some food since their SNAP was cut. Just a guess.
@PolitiFact  @joerogan  you retweeted ignorance today. "Amber alert..." False
@lawscribe  I try! :D *does soft-shoe, with jazz hands, off stage left*
@PolitiFact  @amk4obama  These lies about the #GOPShutdown are not isolated.They're part of RNC strategy of distraction http://trueblueliberal.blogspot.com/2013/10/the-strategy-of-distraction.html…

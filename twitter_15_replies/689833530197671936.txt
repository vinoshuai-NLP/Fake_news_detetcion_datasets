@newscientist  was this backed up by satellite data?
@newscientist  Yea, too bad the records are being faked for political purposes.
LOL! Sources for this are garbage. Look to the satellite data. It’s the ONLY accurate, global dataset.  @newscientist  @JimPethokoukis
@newscientist  you mean the wettest!
@newscientist  It's all in the name... "New Scientist", one that uses #science to advance progressive agenda.
@newscientist  because you say so
@newscientist  we cooked all the numbers and made it so!
@newscientist  @JimPethokoukis  Not here in the greater Philly area tho meteorologists overacted. And the summer of '14 was quite pleasant.
. @newscientist  what about 4 billion years ago? Scientists say the planet's surface was mostly molten rock back then? Doesn't that count too?
@newscientist   Hottest year ever? Really? Or do you mean hottest since records began a hundred years or so ago?
@newscientist   actual report is warmest since modern day records began in 1880. http://ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/summary-info/global/201512…
@newscientist  Really shocking and sad seeing all these climate deniers in the comments
@ivangluscic  @newscientist  Captain Caveman was not available to comment on his era...T-Rex, ditto. ;-)
@newscientist  Man made climate change is a proven hoax! Stop making assholes of yourselves. The game is over.
@newscientist  Widely debunked by real science.
@newscientist  more droughts and floods expected then? #globalwarming
@newscientist  @wjohngalloway  Really, is that true? Didn't feel like that when I was on holiday in this country.Cold and wet most days!!!
. @newscientist  Wait — but was it official?

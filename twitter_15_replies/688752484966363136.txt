@WhiteHouse  @Parisa_Pi  @POTUS  Iran are terrorists
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  Thank you, Mr. President. You'll be missed by the sane, educated, and rational wing of the population after you leave.
@Whitehouse  @POTUS .  Note this my prediction  that Iran may soon surprise  the whole  world. They are  the headquarter of devil
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  like they care about any of that,you gave away to  much of the pie as far as they are concerned you can keep the crumbs
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  you make no sense. And you will have blood on your hands supporting terror
@WhiteHouse  @StateDept  @POTUS  But let's give them 100mil anyway, right?! #potuslogic Smh.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  Can't make up your mind on what to do with Iran. Not good to flip flop
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  this is not good enough. Hou@all letting more killing go on
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS   ETA of bringing service k9's home. ?
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  may God deliver the entire world from them.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  "targeted sanctions"? FARCE!
@Leatherneck43  @WhiteHouse  @POTUS  Yeah, why didn't you go there and free them!
@WhiteHouse  @WHLive  @POTUS  And why is Israel allowed to get away with poss. of nucl. weapons, pogroms against. Palest's & apartheid
@whitehouse  @potus  @statedept  nigeria government don't respect court orders i don't no if you people respect court orders
@WhiteHouse  what sanctions.Obama is the antichrist.full of lies.
@ScriptJumper  @WhiteHouse  why Iran still says Deth to America
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  Are you purporting the $100-150 billion released will not significantly serve to enhance those nefarious activities?
@WhiteHouse  The US should be sanctioned for its violations of human rights and for supporting, funding and creating terrorism.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  no red line?
@WhiteHouse  @StateDept  @POTUS  Nuclear weapons-ballistic missile can be purchased, assembled and used in foreign countries, even camouflaged
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  Perfettamente d' accordo con la vostra linea politica nei rapporti con l' Iran. La prudenza, si dice, sia sempre buona!
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  @ White House.  Great Day POTUS
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  excellent work on Iran, work on taking guns out of the hands of criminals there should be background checks in all states
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS    What can of idiots say something like this?  No clue what your positions are??
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS   we don't have sanctions against US ,ourselves ,for violating human rights . https://changepolitics.org/question/b7fee812-8158-495a-855d-2b6b52f02575…
@WhiteHouse  and Saudi Arabia? What of their disgusting record on human rights, you hypocrites? SHAME ON YOU. Enjoy your blood money.
@WhiteHouse  @zdaniel  @POTUS  read this
@WhiteHouse  @StateDept  @POTUS  u make friends with people hate us and kill
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  Wow. No disrespect, but we the people aren't stupid, & the majority of us can't see your alternative reality.
“ @WhiteHouse : "We still have sanctions on Iran for its violations of HRs for its support for terrorism & ballistic missile program" — @POTUS ”
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  My Dream house...  White house..!
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  I'd say timing of $1.4 billion release benefitting Iran is at least suspicious, and seem'ly incentive for bad behavior.

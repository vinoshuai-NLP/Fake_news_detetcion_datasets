@JoshGoldGolf  @cnnbrk  Amen to that! People will respond when shit happens.  It is the WAY they handle it ( sadness) that makes the diff.
@cnnbrk  How many adults don't go to the doctors each year because they can't afford it though? Great idea for those with money.  :)
@cnnbrk  This is political BS. So everyone is deemed mental? I don't think so. There's no magic little happy pill to make you not feel. Duh.
@cnnbrk  let's just throw out our rights and have gov't control of everyone.isn't that a form of communisum????
@cnnbrk  why? Just so Dr. can peddle another prescription to me for a kickback and not know what the prescription fully does? No thank you.
@cnnbrk   OK, this was a brain child of the drug companies.  Don't fall for it.

@cnnbrk  be prescribed seroxat that way even if you didn't have depression good chance you will suffer with it
@gordonp_38858  @cnnbrk  @truthman30  @fiddaman
This is great.  “ @cnnbrk : Doctors should screen all adults for depression at least once, task force recommends. http://cnn.it/20qOlsi”
@cnnbrk  So now Drs., Ins. Co. and lawyers are defining what happiness is or is not!?
@cnnbrk  ppl shd beducatd nt tak it stigma nconsult,acute cases 2 frequent wth suicidalintentions n psychotic symptms,urgent interfrnc neded
Yes yes yes yes “ @cnnbrk : Doctors should screen all adults for depression at least once, task force recommends. http://cnn.it/20qOlsi”
@cnnbrk  everyone should be screened at all times. This illness needs to be taken seriously.
@cnnbrk . This just reminds me a bit of psycho-pass the anime similar in concept
they should also be forced to give dna and submit to the state by grabbing their ankles daily...  @cnnbrk
@cnnbrk  Mine screened me today!
@cnnbrk  This went well.
@cnnbrk  @GCugini  right !
@cnnbrk  silent killer that depression - although some tend to be misdiagnosed . A bad week does not imply a condition. You can get over it
@cnnbrk  Seriously?! Who the hell's supposed to pay for that? Most of us depressed people have good reason the be.
@cnnbrk  Although it makes sense,managing another set of paper form and tracking might prove another headache for front desk.

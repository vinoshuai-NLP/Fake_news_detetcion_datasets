@BreakingNews  19 cases acquired in Puerto Rico are in addition to the 31 cases in the continental U.S. that were acquired elsewhere
@blythebernhard  Do you have data re where 31 other cases were acquired? Specific countries traveled to where the virus was contracted?
@BreakingNews  @blythebernhard  Have we asked US women to hold off getting pregnant until 2016 yet?
@lionrock71  @BreakingNews  Unnecessary, the virus is not transmitted in the U.S. Pregnant woman told to consider postponing some travel.
@BreakingNews  @cmalocksmith  @blythebernhard  I just wanna know where these new breed of mosquitoes come from while mosquitoes have been years
@kevinclarke110  @BreakingNews  @cmalocksmith  It's not a new breed of mosquito. The Aedes mosquito carries Zika, Chikungunya and Dengue virus.

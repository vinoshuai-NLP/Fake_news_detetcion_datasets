@WhiteHouse  why are we left alone to die. Biafra are dying in Nigeria while the world stands in akimbo
@WhiteHouse  Earnings a year are different from wages. What does the evidence suggest is the reasons they earn less...
@WhiteHouse  @BarackObama  ,so Hillary would be cost savings? Kidding.
@WhiteHouse  what about SS For Seniors WHAT ARE YOU DO ING ABOUT THAT????
@WhiteHouse  THANK YOU!!!
@WhiteHouse  @RepBrianHiggins  Propaganda .& yrs ago Pelosi was the Speaker. Is Higgins a Pelosi supporter? I smell RINO
@RalphSchiano  @WhiteHouse  go to Russia then i believe it would be more to your liking. We already have done it in CA.
@WhiteHouse  @BarackObama  it is true that..mr.president.best regards..

@WhiteHouse  @BarackObama  Mr Obama I'm saddened that your only in office two terms I truly mean what I say you the best thing the USOFAHAD. J
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse   CLOUD MUSIC COOL!
@WhiteHouse  Going to better enforce existing laws then? Good idea. Better than creating more useless, BS laws so you can say you "fixed" it.
@WhiteHouse  Agree?! I lived it! Battling 50 years and hearing the same old tune from GOP.
@WhiteHouse   See what the problem is they knew  I was coming They knew it wasn't there wife So that meant it wasn't their daughters
@WhiteHouse  there is no such thing as equal work. The military pays more to TIS for the same rank. It's still the same job.
@WhiteHouse  @BarackObama  help me
@WhiteHouse  1963 legislation and still no equal pay? Why are women pawns in this manner? An Executive Order 2016? Sad story for the U.S.
@WhiteHouse  @BarackObama  With due respect "if" the wage gap was true, why would men even be hired if companies could save 23% hiring women?
@WhiteHouse  women make the same pay as men. Dem throw this unproven illegitimate made up crap around to stir fools up. Complete lie

@WhiteHouse  @BarackObama  "Earned." We already have equal pay. If you want to be paid right, negotiate your salary and get a real degree.
@WhiteHouse  @BarackObama  Before you "take steps", you should do better research into the numbers. I recommend following  @CHSommers  research.
@rdube  @WhiteHouse  @BarackObama  @CHSommers  https://youtube.com/watch?v=BDj_bN0L8XM…
@WhiteHouse  @BarackObama  sorry,still don't understand how 's the job
@WhiteHouse  @RepBrianHiggins  why are Congressional Reps not required to participate in Affordable Healthcare Act? That seems equitable
@WhiteHouse  #boohoo want equal pay, don't get a degree in feminist liberal arts and get a real job
@WhiteHouse  Women, wanting to work for pennies, doesnt always make sense. Look us up. http://gregparker.youngevity.com.
@WhiteHouse  @BarackObama  I love my president
@WhiteHouse : "RT the good news: We're taking new steps to advance #EqualPay for women →…" #1 in United States http://toprt.com/TopRT_US/?t=693102420688121856…

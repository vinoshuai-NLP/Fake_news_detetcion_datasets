@espn  Carson Palmer move, wants out of Detroit who could blame him
@BMcGintyTTU yeah, I freaking saw 
@espn  Blame it on the CTE,dude don't wanna  risk his life ,he's got money  man, another 10 years of this franchise sucking.
@espn  @RedAngel9280  @jbabs_81 wth
@espn  he will be on the Patriots soon
Calvin Johnson is smart for leaving the #Lions and enjoying as much life as he can before whatever brain damage he suffered kicks in  @espn
@espn  hey, if you saved your money, you'll be fine. Thanks for providing so many highlights.
@_TL15  @WestCoast  @espn  true but could have demanded a trade. This was reported over 3 weeks ago to the detroit media.
@espn  @vadasy_kenny
@_Apple_Zach  @espn  it doesn't bother me. Let him retire. We will find another wide receiver
@espn   Management must know, players aren't going to jeopardize their health,&futures,playing for shoddy teams,while owners make big bucks.
@espn  Stafford right now.
@CoachJMcGuire  @espn  time to trade his ass! Swindle Jerry jones for some picks. Stafford will suck even more now w/out CJ.
@espn  
@espn  @i_am_BMW  Detroit sports can bring a man down, damn.
@BigEastSilver  @espn  KILLIN' ME!   #OneMoreYear
@espn  he should have been traded to Carolina so he could win a superbowl ring next week shame he never got one. #KeepPounding
@espn  @Lions  He DOESN'T want to retire he WANTS OUTTA DETROIT!! TRADE HIM instead of getting NOTHING IN RETURN...OPEN UR EYES #TiredOfLosing
 RT  @espn : Sources: Calvin Johnson told Detroit Lions he plans on retiring from the NFL. http://es.pn/1SSaYEB https://t.co/dRNihwCgl
@espn  nooo don't go CJ #Megatron
@_TL15  @WestCoast  @espn  ask to be traded or released if winning is the problem. They owe him that
@espn  @CoryHink  @thesyndrome6
@Ivdown12  @espn  @CoryHink yeah pretty crazy, great career even though it was short
@espn  it's the water.
@espn  @CarterPaddy50
@espn  now this is when the $$$$ talk.
@espn  glad to see that Megatron has retired . It takes a real man to retire at the height of his career. Let him go be with his family.
@espn  @Rachel__Nichols  He will be missed. Probably smart decision before incurring serious injuries.
@espn  @real_cote  read this then tell me he said nothing
@AlexSchreiner13  @espn  He told Jim Caldwell this three weeks ago, he still hasn't announced his retirement. He can still change his mind.
@espn  @AlmightyElias  
@espn  @Rachel__Nichols  Sad that he toiled his entire career for the horrible  @Lions  but he is a first ballot HOFer. Deserved more. #megatron
@espn  @Rachel__Nichols  He doesn't need to do ALL that - he just needs to come and play for the Carolina Panthers...  We'll take him...
@espn  @wingoz  of course he did. #SOL
@espn  Remember when everyone said he would pass rice as the goat.

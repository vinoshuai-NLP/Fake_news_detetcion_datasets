@deray  I bet the Browns did every one of their interviews absolutely free, didn't they??
@deray  @ShaunKing  Screw ABC. That's disturbing.
@deray  This country is literally built on & thru the destruction of Black lives. That it continues is saddening, maddening, & unsurprising.
@deray  what
@deray  It will be interesting to see who purchases ad-time on ABC to pay for Wilson's $500K interview...
@deray  @Doc_Milla  He is now a success to the Klan, and the man he married.
@deray  I cant wait for another crowd fund to go up for him.  I have some cash I want to send his way.
@deray  Give us a link, Bro.
@deray  He will continue on his media tour as long as it remains profitable. He's no good for anything else, never was.
@deray  between that and donations he's a fucking millionaire..... And Conservatives don't understand why there's anger
@deray  @Donna_West  White men get paid whether they do good or bad. White supremacy: Rule No. 1.
@johnerikenglund  @deray  ive been sick since yesterday. as of now there's not much more to hack up
@deray  Sweet!
@deray  @ShaunKing  madness! :O #Disgraceful
@deray  So far that's only a rumor and ABC has banned spending money on interviews so I doubt this is true.
@deray  @vruz  really? Don't they have a policy of not paying for interviews?  This couldn't b official
. @deray  Do you know when rhis interview is going to be aired Deray? I expect booing at rhe ABC hq  @TerrinaMajnoona
@robjatuk2  @deray  money talks.
@deray  @ShaunKing  Got a link?
@rolandsmartin  @deray  @ShaunKing   where on ABC? If that's true he got a paid vacation and a million dollar bonus.
@deray   If a fund is set up to support the Browns in a civil suit against Wilson + Ferguson PD then it would raise millions of dollars.
@deray  @jacobmruff I hope this isn't true....
@JDMehlhorn  @deray  can't confirm that 100%, but this is true: http://nbcnews.com/storyline/michael-brown-shooting/225-000-crowdfunding-raised-support-darren-wilson-n186616…
@deray  I won't watch it.
@deray  @radicalhearts  Wow! That's so fucked up.
@deray  @devbost  outrageous!!!!! Out effin rageous.
@draxtor  @deray  Seriously. Last thing we need is turning the shooting of unarmed black men into a lucrative career move.
@deray  we need to boycott  @abc
@deray  they are sending a strong message. they no longer need us. we must unite or we won't survive this. genocide.
@deray  @a_standal  That action also shows how corrupt the major news organizations are. Paying for a murderer's version of his crime.
@deray

@deray  @markchappelle  what the actual, unmitigated fuck.
Yup. What  @geraniumkate  said.  @deray
@deray  @ShaunKing  boycott  @ABC  if they paid $500K for interview.
@deray  Killing #MikeBrown is proving to be a excellent career move for that p'ssy #DarrenWilson 500k to rub our noses in this in justice!
@deray  Are you serious???

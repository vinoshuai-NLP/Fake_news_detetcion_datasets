@voxdotcom  Your own source says the two aren’t connected. This is trying to push a narrative that *just* *isn’t* *there*.
@voxdotcom  really? At no point is what they doing related to Ferguson. Stick to beauty tips
Lawyers in Ferguson now regret decision not to trademark groundbreaking new hand gesture.  @voxdotcom
@asociologist  @voxdotcom  Haven't people in Hong Kong refuted the link?
@asociologist  @voxdotcom  Or just ask someone protesting.
@asociologist  @voxdotcom  Yeah, though it didn’t stop  @qz  using almost the same headline…
@asociologist  Also, I don’t get  @qz ’s “intensely policed city” HK/NYC comparison. NYC and Hong Kong have fairly similar populations.
@voxdotcom  Hong Kong's protesters have never even heard of #Ferguson.
@Mississippiluv2  @voxdotcom   the signs they are holding makes you wrong turn off fox news it makes you stupid

. @voxdotcom  "...from Ferguson"  I'm temped to pile on, but I see you've already received quite a deserved bruising over this...

@andersonDrLJA  yep I completely agree...we need all the tax payers we can get. Forget the family!!!
@andersonDrLJA  Wait didn't the Obama admin trot out some thing about the freedom not to work? Obamacare-job-loss related?
@andersonDrLJA  Sir, just let him and them dilutional ones that think we are what we know they rea LM
@andersonDrLJA  @JstanleyStanley  *Excuse me! What the heck does BHO know about it? Someone send him a gov't funded survey or something?
@andersonDrLJA  @m_stewart_paine  Stay at home moms! Please million of men are now stay at home, not by choice but by liberal lunacy!
@LilSouthernSass  @andersonDrLJA   liberalism seems more & more like a mental disorder
. @andersonDrLJA  Maybe O might suggest our moms earn $ via/porno shots of selves, like his mom did ..but in a full time way, not stay-at-home
@andersonDrLJA  Well, this former Stay-At-Home Dad of 2 special needs kids & 215 lbs of protection & aggression, has a few words for Oblam-o.
@andersonDrLJA  that use to be the norm for most women
@andersonDrLJA  His own mother didn't stay at home, nor with him. His communist grandparents raised him for a time.
@andersonDrLJA  @KandiRider  it's time for the anti-American left to be held accountable
@andersonDrLJA  REALLY?? As usual, O has no IDEA who the #American ppl ARE! Staying home w/kids is just a dream 4 most working #moms!
@andersonDrLJA  @bluware_ron  That's how #Obama sees this Country and the people who live here. Dim view, but all his.
@JacobBotzman  @andersonDrLJA  @bluware_ron  And O thinks his party represents "choice" - what an absolute joke
@andersonDrLJA  @bluware_ron  Obama is so out of touch with the American People how the hell does he know what we want??
@andersonDrLJA  @LanceSilver1  The breakdown of the family, led by #DNC pay to have out of wedlock babies IS RESPONSIBLE 4 society ills!
@andersonDrLJA  @lesstaxingcpa  Democrats have destroyed the black family unit, now they're going after the rest of us.
@andersonDrLJA  @roziedb  Wasn't it DEMOCRATS who said ' .. if you don't want to work you shouldn't have to work .." Yeah it was.
In plain sight RT @hardaspie:  @andersonDrLJA  @chooseliferacer  F#@!ing Commie dictator POS. Worst excuse for a human being I have ever seen.
@RedScareBot  @HardAspie  @andersonDrLJA  @chooseliferacer  oh thought you were taking about Obama
@andersonDrLJA  @Steph93065  Stay at home Mom is not a career ender. More often than not the Moms return to the workforce.
@andersonDrLJA   Maybe he would have been a better person if he had had one!
@HardAspie  @RedScareBot  @andersonDrLJA  @chooseliferacer  union shake down, civil rights extortion artist
@andersonDrLJA  @BarackObama  The choice I made-stay home & raise my kids was the BEST decision I ever made. Not one regret! Better then $
@andersonDrLJA  @arping  I'm a stay at home mom and proud of it, Obama can kiss my ass!!
. @andersonDrLJA  Now he's waded in2 Soviet Communist, Mao territory ..rembr Anita Dunn, Os rep f/early days, w/her 2 fav ppl: Mao & M Theresa
@LaurelCatherine  @andersonDrLJA   I think its Oblabla that doesn't want stay-at-home moms.  Obama never asked me and I'm part of America.
@andersonDrLJA  he doesn't know what America wants &doesnt care what America does want&need an American  leader.so tired of his BS&LIES.
@andersonDrLJA  @elaimy55   war on women?
@andersonDrLJA  @HardAspie  Socialists want all children to be raised in creches.
@andersonDrLJA  O u r about to
@andersonDrLJA  To be clear my blood pressure medication.Lol Don't want a visit from anyone who misunderstood that tweet
“ @andersonDrLJA : #Obama says "America Doesn't want any Stay-at-home-Moms! Enough is Enough!  #FireObama Now! http://weeklystandard.com/blogs/obama-moms-who-stay-home-raise-kids-thats-not-choice-we-want-americans-make_817807.html…  Crazy!!
@leonpui_  @davidlgff  @andersonDrLJA  no life is much better 4 kids now with no mom, no dad, they can hang out all day, smoke pot,get high etc
@andersonDrLJA  This guy is a criminal.
@andersonDrLJA  @Eccentrie    I call BULLSHIT!!   But then again I dare him to lace 3 sentences of importance together without uttering a lie.

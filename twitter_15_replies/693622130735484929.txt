@HuffingtonPost  Love those tablecloths on their heads.
@HuffingtonPost  And Trump just might be your next President... good luck with that.
@HuffingtonPost  @Bernie2016  @cnn  @potus  Can't anyone do something about Trump. Hate speech laws? Insulting Saudi Prince. God help us!
@HuffingtonPost  So,SaudiArabia feels entitled to interfere in a prez.election-because of business deals?How corrupt R our politicians?
@HuffingtonPost  HOUSE OF SAUD -  GET ENGAGED W/ GLOBAL SOCIETY
@HuffingtonPost  Basically, SaudiArabia told us-Americans-that our elections R a joke. R the prez.&politicians bought&paid for!?
“ @HuffingtonPost : Saudi prince takes on Trump on Twitter: "I bailed you out twice" http://huff.to/20yywQn ” WOW
@danesau1  @HuffingtonPost  I have no idea what you're referring to b
@HuffingtonPost  Trump's tweet also claimed bin Talal is "co-owner" of Fox News.
@HuffingtonPost  @rinoserious How much did the Saudi Prince give to the Clinton foundation Huffington post?
@HuffingtonPost  Literally one of the funniest things I've seen tweeted as of late. 
@HuffingtonPost  Good to know Saudi terrorists/war criminals don't like Trump...
@HuffingtonPost  @SammydWilliams ......!wow!
@nadiasimmons09  @HuffingtonPost  OMG!!!
@HuffingtonPost  @Lrharris535Lee  Trump brags about doing it on his own yet he's calling Cruz a lier If only ppl knows his true backstory
@Patta47cake  @HuffingtonPost  Are u a Cruz person or a Trump person?
@HuffingtonPost    If Saudi Arabia feels threatened by your pick for POTUS, you've probably chosen the right candidate.  @realDonaldTrump
@TrumpsMomentum  @HuffingtonPost  i am a Muslim myself and live here permanently that is why i feel what i feel
@TrumpsMomentum  @HuffingtonPost  America is the greatest nation on Earth nd really exceptional we are proud to make Amerca our permannt  home
@TrumpsMomentum  @HuffingtonPost  we condemn terrorism in all shapes nd forms, including by entities using Islamic label without reservations.
@TrumpsMomentum  @HuffingtonPost  but vet everyone not just Muslims. That is the point I dare to make. Yes, even stronger vetting for everyone
@TrumpsMomentum  @HuffingtonPost  no problm but dont emply the Muslim name Just say that we are going thoroughly vet everyone from Middle East
@TrumpsMomentum  u not trying to understand sensitivity of the matter. All we object is singling out Muslims when it could have been avoided.
@TrumpsMomentum  @HuffingtonPost  that is what i am saying in future just say that people from the Middle East region and Asia because of that

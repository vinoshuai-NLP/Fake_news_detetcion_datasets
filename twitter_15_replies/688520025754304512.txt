@WhiteHouse  Thanks, I needed a good laugh this evening!
@WhiteHouse  You idiots won't enforce it! Bet they are building them or buying them from Russia RIGHT NOW!
@WhiteHouse  prove it
@WhiteHouse  the WH & Kerry think Americans are stupid they just put Americans in harms way an paid to do it
@WhiteHouse  Iran no longer needs to build a nuclear weapon, since we are giving them the money to buy one.
@WhiteHouse  #GOP hates this as well as the return of the hostages, because Obama got them done. How American is that?
@WhiteHouse  yeah, sure.
@WhiteHouse   But how about the Iranians capturing two Navy vessels and holding them for a period of time? We are an embarrassment!!
@WhiteHouse  What I would like to know is why 200 tons of YellowCake Uranium " fuel" was allowed to reach Iran : 200 tons..
@WhiteHouse  In your dreams. This administration is the most mentally deficient, lieing, inept, and off with the fairies ever known to man.
@WhiteHouse  until tomorrow
@WhiteHouse  @NasimZehra  AN INDIVIDUAL CAN BE PUNISHED AND PUT IN TO JAIL BUT ITS IDEOLOGY CAN NOT BE CONTROLLED BUT THROUGH JUSTICE.
@WhiteHouse  @NasimZehra  JUSTICE IS THE ONLY GUARANTEE TO BE MAINTAINED PEACE ON EARTH BUT NOT GUN POWER.
@WhiteHouse  time when the us history broke
@WhiteHouse  Bahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah
@WhiteHouse  Just 369 more days now until I, THE Ted Cruz, inherit the mantle from Obama!
@WhiteHouse  And anyone who trusts Iran is a fool.
@WhiteHouse  Only in your dreams, they have a bomb as they have been working with N Korea
@WhiteHouse  Inspectors are on the take and have never inspected all of Iran they still have way more than you know, think they did not lie?
@WhiteHouse  wrong.  They are slightly delayed.  You already gave blood on your hands, there will be more due to you
@WhiteHouse  Lets hope America follows suite! Thank you  @POTUS
@WhiteHouse  State sponsored lies brought to you by  @vj44  back channeling tax payer funds to Hamas since  @BarackObama   took over.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  has done it again
@WhiteHouse  not sure what your smoking if you think Iran won't try to develops a nuke under our noise #IranDeal #baddeal #noleadership
@WhiteHouse  after today's events and the iran necular deal i can't see how we the people could ever elect another democrat for anything
@JerryWact  @WhiteHouse  Thanks Jerry,that's what I wanted to say
@WhiteHouse  Time is the test for your deal. The truth will out.
@WhiteHouse You have broken US into Pieces in Our Times
@Our4thEstate  -  @POTUS  @WhiteHouse  Thank you for showing how diplomacy works. #IranDeal
@WhiteHouse  @WhiteHouse  Thank you Secretary Kerry and Secretary Moniz for your efforts in working this out-this is a good deal for the world
@WhiteHouse  Bush put them on his Axis of Invasion. We do not invade nuke nations. Ergo, they went racing for the bomb.
We trust trust Iran about as much as we trust you.  @WhiteHouse  @NSC44

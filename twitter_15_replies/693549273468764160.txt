@nyctrader10 and what did ppl do, I just feel so sad. And I just want to say to the world that Islam isn't like what others think.
@klangfarbian  @lady_stillia he's right tbf... Noah's ark and Jesus does sound like bull shit
@nytimes  @nytopinion  wow.. Lowlife worthless people over there.
@nytimes  @nytopinion Whats to like about a religion that promotes such horror. They're all brain wash
@nyctrader10 but we're not the media. We have no enough power to say it out loud. All we can do just do what Quran and the prophet taught.
@nytopinion  Telling this girl's story is #islamophobic. Better be careful-Others may marginalize  @nytimes  accusing you of racism. #YourRules
@nytimes  @nytopinion  this is cultural and tribal act not Islamic
@nytimes  @nytopinion  a sick culture!
“ @nytimes : Her father shot her in the head, as an "honor killing" http://nyti.ms/1Ppyfvk via  @nytopinion  ” #NoAllMen
@nytimes  @nytopinion  stop inciting hate against Israel and report on the clash of civilizations/cultures that is really happening.
@nyctrader10 well, thanks to understand.. I gtg it's time for me to pray and I'm almost late:)
@nytimes  @nytopinion  Uyyyyyy How can a father do that?
@nytimes     Do we want people who think like this to come immigrate here and try to change our laws?
@nytimes  @nytopinion  Where is the new?  It's very common... Some women like it.
@nytimes  @nytopinion  you're talking about Islam as you like, same the saying that you have  fake it till you make it
@nytimes  @nytopinion
@nytimes  @nytopinion  horrible that this is expected of fathers...stop this now
@nytimes  @nytopinion   What kind father does this to his own daughter? Pitifully sad!  Surely a "human rights" issue?
@nytimes  @nytopinion  every 90 minutes an honor killing usually in a #Muslim country #Pakistan has 1,000 a year killers go unpunished
@nytimes  @nytopinion  bravo,Nicholas Kristof,for  describing this century's great unfinished business": "honor killings" and gender injustice
@nytimes  @nytopinion  .
@nytimes  @nytopinion  #WakeUpAmerica
@Ozetty  @nytimes  @nytopinion  It looks like that we bring Pigs over here, treat them as pets instead dogs. A culture that you cannot forget .
@nytimes  @nytopinion  their 'honor' lies between the legs of a woman! a piece of 'meat' is more important to them....f...k shit.
@nytimes  @nytopinion  Women like that too........part of their culture, Satanists n Satan they adore n worship............1
@nytimes  a very brave young lady.
@nytimes  @nytopinion  Very sad, scary and tragic. It is horrific that this is going on, it seems hopeless.
@nytimes  @nytopinion  @HonorDiaries  @KNFMHBV  Honour abuse worldwide issue & US needs to wake up sooner than later. This girl is one of many

@CBCAlerts  @ArponBasu  Is he ok? American news sources say he was killed but I have not seen any Canadian reports indicating his condition.
@JakeWideman  @CBCAlerts  @ArponBasu  apparently he has been shot dead :-(
@CBCAlerts  @stephenlautens  He is one of yours!
@nikkivancouver  @CBCAlerts  ive only hears several times he was shot dead. But would be wonderful if they are wrong
@CBCAlerts  @CBCTheNational  NationalPost reported him as deceased but I hope they are wrong.
@CBCAlerts  pls tell us how our soldier is doing? Please tell us he will be allright. #cdnpoli #ottawa
MT “ @CBCAlerts : soldier who was shot at #Ottawa's War Memorial is a reservist serving with the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in #HamOnt”
@CBCAlerts  @CBCNews  Hope he is going to be OK.
@CBCAlerts  @Y108Rocks  jesus
@CBCAlerts  has his family been notified?
“ @CBCAlerts : Canadian soldier shot at #Ottawa's War Memorial is a reservist serving w/ Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in #Hamilton, Ont.”
@TundraGlobal  @FletJan  @CBCAlerts  Leslie on Global just retracted tht! Soldier is still alive! Jason kenny twt misunderstanding of some sort
@CBCAlerts  @CBCTheNational  according to reports on Twitter the soldier has passed away
@CBCAlerts  thoughts are with the soldier and family in time of crisis we need to stand strong against these acts of foolishness
@CBCAlerts  @CBCNews  our thought with the family of the soldier. That was shot. Can we please get the 90 or so suspects of terror in custody.
@CBCAlerts   I hope you confirmed that the soldier's family had been advised before you sent that Tweet!!!
@CBCAlerts  @hjoneshojo   What another very sad day…people have to wake up PC is destroying the world

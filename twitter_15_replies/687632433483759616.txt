@BBCBreaking  The revenant 
@BBCBreaking  The Revenant will win!
@bbcbreaking     legend
@BBCBreaking  Mad Max!?!? Seriously
@BBCBreaking  looking forward to a day when Oscars will be awarded to good pictures...
@BBCBreaking  bullshit
@BBCBreaking  Mad Max #OscarNoms
@BBCBreaking  Mad Max :D :D
@BBCBreaking  #oscarnoms  I've seen two of the Best Picture nominees, I guess it was bad year for films, has to happen sometimes.
@BBCBreaking  #Oscars Mad Max Fury Road definitely not worth a mention except for a Razzie maybe.
@BBCBreaking  No Carol, wonder why! Can't say if it was best out of that list, but definitely worth being on it.
@BBCBreaking  In this order: Mad Max, The Revanent, or the The Big Short
@BBCBreaking  Carol anyone?
@BBCBreaking  madmax all day.
@BBCBreaking  Good as Mad Max - Fury Road is it shouldn't be best picture.
@BBCBreaking  the Martian
@BBCBreaking  meanwhile, The Martian and Fury Road both up for oscars this year.
@DJSnM  @BBCBreaking  Martian will probably follow up its comedy/musical win, what a musical laugh it was.
@BBCBreaking  THE MARTIAN.

@nealcarter  @nileawhile  @ksdknews  oh, trust me the police department would make it relevant if #MikeBrown did have a record.
@nealcarter  @ksdknews  @MsBlackhart  whether or not he had a criminal record, what happened is still completely disgusting and insane.
@nealcarter  @ksdknews   Look who HAD a record
@nealcarter  @ksdknews    Mr  @BarackObama  please help
@nealcarter  @ShinobiAFC  @ksdknews  didn't know they could do those on the fly and get results in 2 seconds

@nealcarter  @thaina192  @ksdknews  While it's irrelevant. It's relevant still in a very backward way. It's like now what's the reason, huh?
@nealcarter  @ksdknews  that s Freedom american way!!!  His problem is: he is NOT white #Ferguson
@nealcarter  It was potentially relevant, if the argument was to be made that police had some reason to be suspicious of him.
@nealcarter  @redsesame  Agree it’s irrelevant, but it would have given police “cause” to think he might be dangerous. So they got nothing.

@joerogan  @dangerburgundy  Fake, Fake, Totally fake
@joerogan  @DangerBurgundy  As much as I wish it was. It looks like a kangaroo to me.
@joerogan  @DangerBurgundy  no way?!
@joerogan  @DangerBurgundy  Dr.Gemma Sheridan is that fake lady who claimed to be stranded on an island for 8 years. I call bullshit.
@joerogan  @DangerBurgundy  probably fake, I will remain sceptical until there are more news and shit about this.
@joerogan  @DangerBurgundy  what the fuck
@joerogan  Its most likely fake, that shit would be all over the news, everybody would be talking about it.
@joerogan  For fucks sake...any of these fools ever see Jurassic Park?
@joerogan  @DangerBurgundy  apparently its just a baby kangaroo
@joerogan  @DangerBurgundy  why does that scientist think it's a good idea to populate the world with dinosaurs? Remarkable experiment though.
@joerogan  @DangerBurgundy  Dinosaur cloning story not true :( http://theepochtimes.com/n3/591469-british-scientists-clone-dinosaur-is-fake-baby-apatosaurus-named-spot-a-marsupial/…
@joerogan  I found an article from last year around April 1st.
@joerogan  @DangerBurgundy  No.. http://theepochtimes.com/n3/591469-british-scientists-clone-dinosaur-is-fake-baby-apatosaurus-named-spot-a-marsupial/…
@joerogan  @DangerBurgundy  pretty sure thats a baby kangaroo
@joerogan  @DangerBurgundy  looks like a marsupial.
@joerogan  @DangerBurgundy  lol that looks more like a kangaroo to me
@MrObviousGuy  I'm also fairly confident that we haven't got any Dino DNA.  @joerogan
@joerogan  @DangerBurgundy  I laughed when they said they were going to resurrect a mammoth and people thought thats where it would stop.#Trex
@joerogan  @DangerBurgundy  I feel like we've seen how this plays out before...
@joerogan  I think I might have been fooled by the internet? Kangaroo? Crazy shit to ponder anyway...has this already happened before......

@Lexyrai  @DanaDelany  I had no idea you were family! BUT Pope Francis has said gays are not going to hell. And homophobia is biracial :)
@nytimes  I am counting on it!
@Lexyrai  @DanaDelany  I thought he said gays can go to heaven now? I'm not repenting though.
@thebeecharmer97  @Lexyrai  @DanaDelany  You should read up on what they do to gays in Islamic countries
@Lexyrai  @DanaDelany  well obviously it you weren't fucked, you could go to Heaven;) #badjoke ;)
@Lexyrai  hahaha did u just say that ? Xd
@nytimes   This pope seems to be involved in some sort of Pope-off.

@nytimes  the only way it could be Heaven.

@WhiteHouse  it's amazing what you can achieve when you fine people for not participating
RT" @WhiteHouse . #ACAWorks and is an even Greater Result, Being part of a Whole-Policy (=inserted-in)/This Strengthening that.

@whitehouse  FACT#Biafrans are Republicans-having no king; Democratic-giving each a voice. What connects us with Nigeria?
@WhiteHouse  Yeah right, you pay a $5000 deductible with a $5000 co-pay and that's your so-called affordable healthcare? LOL
@SSReaney  @WhiteHouse  Oooooh! Where are you $5k/$5k? We're at $12k/$12k.
@WhiteHouse  thanks Mr. Barak Obama  Hope allthe world & their countrywill take care for their peoples & ur video will encourage them to do s
@WhiteHouse  , looks like we're going to have another 8 horrible years , cause none of those candidates are worth voting for #&idonttrust
@WhiteHouse  @AntiAusterityUK   Really??     
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS   am concerned for unemployed low income homeless mission care free gratis needs help supplies Lantern.
@WhiteHouse  if 90% of the population has healthcare why is the price rising? We should be able to find more effective healthcare for less.
@WhiteHouse  @zmgerow  @joeyduffy25
RT'd" @WhiteHouse ,#ACA ./even better,More ppl getting #HealthInsurance through #ObamaCare,So,Premiums becoming cheaper. #WinWin  ..
@WhiteHouse  as one of the 90% with this healthcare, I can tell you that I may as well not have any.  It's a broken system Mr. President.
@WhiteHouse  yeah, Americans have it, but can't use it for really important procedures l,because the deductibles are so HIGH!! #Outrageous
@WhiteHouse  healthcare unfortunately is not affordable healthcare for all 90%. Three daughters and a family of five, make it expensive.
@WhiteHouse  Chief Israeli Rabbi Shmuel Eliyahu announced Tuesday that Palestinians should be executed http://fb.me/3ITzCf8Tq
@WhiteHouse  They have insurance but not healthcare. Copays and deductibles too high.
@WhiteHouse  If you make something illegal to not have, why are we celebrating 90% of people having it? Having doesn't mean affordable to use
@WhiteHouse  This called progress!
RT'ed" @WhiteHouse  (#ACAWorks) If i may, 90% of Americans-Covered,This' not a Reform, Mr.President,It's a Revolution.A soft-One ..
@yorkjohn40  @WhiteHouse  I dislike the law but if we are using your analogy, you don’t need to buy insurance if you don’t have a life.
@WhiteHouse  Unless you live in AL like me. And, no medicaid and no one will sell me insurance. I just almost died. 6 digit medical bills.
@WhiteHouse  they sign up but don't pay there premiums / extortion is why you ------.you want to be black but whites rase
@WhiteHouse  I think Hillary could use the defense if she gets indicted that the President lies everyday so she thought that was normal.
. @WhiteHouse  - Mandatory Health Coverage. That doesn't mean #ACA is affordable. Thanks,  @IRSnews  for the forced sign-up. #GetCovered
@WhiteHouse  Why did I let the hospital save my life when medical bills have now stolen my future? #Alabama #Uninsured
@WhiteHouse  great
@WhiteHouse  why we need  @HillaryClinton  in the white house!!
@WhiteHouse  Mostly due to medicaid and other tax payer subsidies Premiums & deducs escalating. 4-5 million cancelled policies.Nets narrower
@WhiteHouse  Yep, they have health coverage, but do they have health CARE? Health coverage does not=health CARE.
@WhiteHouse  #WhatAboutBob
@WhiteHouse  That's 10% too short
@WhiteHouse  because you are forcing people to get it
@WhiteHouse  whats the point when your deductible is so high it doesn't matter if you have it or not?  How about affordable health care?
@WhiteHouse  @BBCKasraNaji  good luck

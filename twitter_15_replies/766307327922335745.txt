@Gaychel22  @BBCNews  This is unprecedented!
Pretty crazy, they are about to lose a lot of money but its for the better.
About bloody time!
@KyleKulinski  @BBCNews  Please, just please go through with this.
@Olumide301  @BBCNews  this is a long time coming

IPOB accuse Buhari of using MEND as DSS media http://arm--NAIJ.COM http://dlvr.it/M3r6NG
@BBCNews  Thank God! This has been one of the most shameful and despicable policies! Now, what about our jail system?
: "US Justice Department will phase out use of privately owned prisons, citing safety…" #1 in #Ireland
@heyyoitsrobb  @BBCNews  Funny how "prisons" get blamed not criminals.  All these prisoners released a few years ago are coming
@heyyoitsrobb  @BBCNews  back.  You know why I know?  Cause I work at one of these jails.  #WakeUpAmerica #StopBlamingOthers
@BBCNews  @IVSoftware  basically killed the idea of prison architect now

Nigeria: Lagos ranks world’s 3rd worst city to live in http://dlvr.it/M441bJ
US Justice Department will phase out use of privately owned prisons: It was like a dystopia science-fiction story.

@BBCNews    Prison is big biz  http://atlantablackstar.com/2014/10/10/12-mainstream-corporations-benefiting-from-the-prison-industrial-complex/…
@pdacosta  @BBCNews  they don't have the money for it, they just say they are shutting it down bc of safety concerns
@BBCNews  if only our country would follow suit.
UK prisons are nowhere near as privatised as US prisons are. They take it way too far.
@PragObots  @BBCNews  but but what has PBO done for black people
@BBCNews  Priv prisons train their officers less than Danny Kaye, I believe, in th movie The Court Jester. Unprofessional.
'Murica, where a prison as a business is somehow a good thing.
More likely political concerns, private prisons is the third rail of politics for democrats
@Bencjacobs  @BBCNews  USGovt should never have gone to private prisons to begin with.
@BBCWorld  @BBCNews  glad they're in prison but just coz sum can't/won't function in society, shouldn't make them a cash cow.
it creates an incentive for people being locked away; lobbying for harsher laws so more people in prison for longer
Checkmate, then.

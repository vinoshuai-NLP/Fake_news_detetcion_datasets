@MrCoryB  @buzzfeed  And sad... I want to hug him and make it better...
@BuzzFeed  he's so cute! Poor guy
@BuzzFeed  poor thing. Although with how sick some people can be at least he was tied up in a safe place with his little suitcase 
. @BuzzFeed  this is awful. Poor pup.

@BuzzFeed  Our 14year old shar-pei that looked identical to this died Thanksgiving. So sad. Best dog ever
“ @BuzzFeed : This dog was abandoned at a Scottish railway station with a suitcase http://bzfd.it/1wS10D6 ” 
@BuzzFeed  poor baby 
@BuzzFeed  @Di_Milo  i'll take him
@Franki711  I figured it out
. @BuzzFeed  WHY
@kayleexxxshea  I so would love to have a dog, me living alone and my strange work schedule does not allow me to. It would be unfair to them
@BuzzFeed  and this is why i hate people
@BuzzFeed  this is heartbreaking. how could somebody leave their pet somewhere not knowing what will happen to them? people are TERRIBLE
“ @BuzzFeed :This dog was abandoned at a Scottish railway station with a suitcase full of his belongings http://bzfd.it/1wS10D6”makes me sick
@BuzzFeed  @DoHoBOB  that is reprehensible
@BuzzFeed  who does this? I mean to 'add' his belongings is a nice treat in that drama... maybe a sick or poor person, hope there will be one
@BuzzFeed  Sad. If only he could hop on a train to better life
@BuzzFeed  hope he'll find a loving family very soon! 
@BuzzFeed

@BuzzFeed   Oh poor baby
@BuzzFeed  its easy to crticise but who knows what the owners circumstances were. They obviously wanted him to be found and cared for.

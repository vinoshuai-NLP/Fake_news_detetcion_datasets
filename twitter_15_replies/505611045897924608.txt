“ @TNROnline : 15 Year Old Convicted Domestic Terrorism; 25 Years To Life In Federal Prison http://wp.me/p3dd01-6Ii”
@TNROnline  @QelricDK  Yea more than half the stories on that website are partisan fear mongering BS. I don't believe this story
@wickedshrapnel  @TNROnline  Fuck
@TNROnline  @77roscoe  Yo, I got to look into this. All F'd up but sending a 15 year old to Fed Lockup is worse.
@Gun_Deck  I think the authorities wanted to make an example of this kid to deter others from doing it in the future, just his bad luck.
@TNROnline  EpochTimes reminds us you are satire. Allen seriously don't use gamers=terrorist as a cry for attention. Do you really want that?
@TNROnline  @LevelCapGaming  get rekt m9
@TNROnline  @LevelCapGaming  from my understanding this has been proved false. Personally idk
@LonoB  @TNROnline  @LevelCapGaming  lol yea it's a troll site
@TNROnline  @LevelCapGaming  Sadly this article is fake.
@TNROnline  @LevelCapGaming  Wow, so many gullible people.
@MacPurson  @TNROnline  ah well good to know that someone wasn't critically injured from that.
@LevelCapGaming  @MacPurson  @TNROnline  BUT GUYS OBAMA IS RESIGNING!!! TOTALLY REAL

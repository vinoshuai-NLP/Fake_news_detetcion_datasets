@CBCTheNational  which one is he?
@SCLafond  Nathan Cirillo is on the left.
@CBCTheNational   Fine job today Mr.Mansbridge.
@CBCTheNational  Why shoot a soldier guarding the memorial to fallen soldiers, how is that a threat to any idealogy? Attack on all Canadians
@CBCTheNational  @DeniseCTV the soldier on the right, is Cpl Nathan Cirillo Southern Highlanders of Canada! RIP 
@CBCTheNational  @kimmeathrel I can't even imagine how the man that was standing beside him must be feeling...
@CBCTheNational  @cbcnewsbc  How could someone be so despicable!
“ @CBCTheNational : Taken by a tourist at the NWM, shortly before Nathan Cirillo was shot and killed. ” Heartbreaking.
@CBCTheNational  Mr. Mansbridge thx for your balanced coverage today. Canada had lost innocence this week
@CBCTheNational  My deepest sympathies to his family.
@CBCTheNational  @cbcnewsbc  @evansolomoncbc  so our other poor soldier, unarmed also, couldn't return fire!
@CBCTheNational  RIP

@fightfortheftr  Which could only mean, that about 50% of the arrests were illegal.
@fightfortheftr  your point?
@fightfortheftr  this shows systematic incompetency
@fightfortheftr  meanwhile, #Ferguson officer suffered fractured eye socket when attacked by Michael Brown. http://thegatewaypundit.com/2014/08/breaking-report-po-darren-wilson-suffered-orbital-blowout-fracture-to-eye-socket-during-encounter-with-mike-brown/â€¦
@74XLCHHardtail  @fightfortheftr  prove thats the cops xray?
@fightfortheftr  @punkcoder  lack of trust rampant and well deserved
@fightfortheftr  @drjackiet  the FPD untrustworthy....nnnnnooooo 
@frontroyalgirl  @fightfortheftr  Exactly why I put it out there. They should not be allowed to collected statistics on dog catchers
@fightfortheftr  @drjackiet  how many from out of state - if locals what was atmosphere was prevalent in Mike's neighborhood
@fightfortheftr  @MiddleAmericaMS  They have had a major problem with telling the truth from #DayOne   #FergusonPD
@fightfortheftr  ..#police will tell #lies in any way that makes them look less bad. #ferguson hey #AG Holder

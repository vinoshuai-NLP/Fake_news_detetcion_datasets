@TwitchyTeam  @the_912_project  Missing kids. Kids with cancer. Libs are all about the children. #HarryReidsShutdown
@TwitchyTeam  @SenatorBegich  Care to defend this action?
“ @TwitchyTeam : Really? Amber Alert website goes dark under government shutdown http://bit.ly/15fMLyM”We only save kids when we get our way.
@TwitchyTeam  What’s up with the “Comments are closed.” on this post?
@TwitchyTeam  Good. No intrusions on our cell phones
“ @TwitchyTeam : Really? Amber Alert website goes dark under government shutdown http://bit.ly/15fMLyM” A new low.
WHAT?!? Where is  @ABC  @NBCNews  @cnn ? “ @TwitchyTeam : Really? Amber Alert website goes dark under government shutdown http://bit.ly/15fMLyM”
“ @TwitchyTeam : Really? Amber Alert website goes dark under government shutdown http://bit.ly/15fMLyM” Okay this is NOT COOL.
@Gena_Rinckey  @TwitchyTeam  no, closing Amber Alert is sick, sick, and evil
@TwitchyTeam  WTH this site doesn't require that much to run it once they are built, just needs a webmaster to update it! Obama is Evil&wrong
@TwitchyTeam    Maybe they should use the money on Amber Alerts instead of barrycades or cones?? Gmafb.
@TwitchyTeam  - so now this administration and the Dems will put children at risk to try to make Repubs look bad? #disgraceful
@TwitchyTeam  Gonna get difficult for people not to NOTICE what is transpiring!!!   @DocWashburn

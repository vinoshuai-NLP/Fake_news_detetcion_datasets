@NeilZeneater it is a crime. But as she's not adult and now receiving mental health care, seems chance of charges lower
@guardiannews  @guardian  There should be a  public apology from this family to Mid East people and the zealots that whipped this up
@guardiannews  @guardian  oh not nice. The situation is volatile enough without this shite. Does the girl still have anonymity like always.

@guardiannews  @MikeMcPickles  Terrible!
@lynn_carleton  @guardiannews  Bigots want to be bigoted.
@Findinyourway  @guardiannews  migrants and refugees are often victims too, you realize?
@guardiannews  @MarcsandSparks  @guardian  Hands up all who didnt see that coming.

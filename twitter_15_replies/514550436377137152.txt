Iphone 6+ seems like piece o crap it bends & falling on impact the glass cracks.So much 4 thinner phones.  @MarketWatch
. @MarketWatch  To the indoctrinated, Apple will spin it as a feature.
@MarketWatch  That's not good. I would not be happy if I just bought this right off the market phone. How could they not have noticed this
@MarketWatch  why would you try to bend your phone?

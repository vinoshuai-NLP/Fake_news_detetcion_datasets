@PoloT_TreyG Yet we continue to support their devilishment and disrespect.
@DarrenFreedom  It is unreal to me.  I don't care if they're saving me prices, they have no regard for you and I at the end of the day.
@PoloT_TreyG Is this a joke? Did Walmart really donate $10k to Darren Wilson? Can you link an article?  Because that's fucking outrageous.
@DeadPrecariat  Currently searching for a legitimate source.
@PoloT_TreyG  @alaskier  Had not heard about their odd donation to killer cop. Another reason not to go in a WalMart. #BoycottWalmart
@PoloT_TreyG Tracy Morgan and the other passengers. Abhorrent company.
@PoloT_TreyG  @livegreenordie . Link please!
@PoloT_TreyG  @rosevine3  Why the heck would Walmart donate to Darren Wilson? Of all times to be charitable! #BoycottWalmart
@PoloT_TreyG 19 hours of searching and no legit source. Maybe it's time to pull down the misinformation.
@PoloT_TreyG can you give me a reference on Wal-Mart donation to Wilson fund? Want to show it to others  #BoycottWalmart
@PoloT_TreyG I don't believe it, I want an article, I legit one. That's a pretty ballsy move by Walmart, one I think they wouldn't take.

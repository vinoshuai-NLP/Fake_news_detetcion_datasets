Whoa. “ @voxdotcom : Hong Kong's protesters are using the "hands up, don't shoot" gesture from Ferguson http://vox.com/e/6624534?utm_campaign=vox&utm_content=chorus&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter…”

I like Vox but this article on #HongKong is misleading.
@voxdotcom  @jpeery59  @voxdotcom  "Hong Kong's protesters are using hands up, don't shoot" gesture" Hope they have better luck than Mike Brown
@julesmattsson  @voxdotcom  Not really. Putting their arms and hands forward will be considered in court as assault against the police.
@voxdotcom  @JeffersonObama  Hope it is working for them. It's a pretty powerful message. The whole world IS watching. Serve & protect. AMEN
@voxdotcom  @jimspellmanTV  um... nope
@jimspellmanTV  @voxdotcom  no proven connection, feels like click bait at best and American obsessiveness at worst
I give you the "number one" gesture MT  @voxdotcom  Hong Kong's protesters are using the "hands up, don't shoot" gesture from Ferguson
It’s "within the realm of possibility” RT  @voxdotcom : Hong Kong's protesters are using the "hands up, don't shoot" gesture from Ferguson
@SavedYouAClick  Bullshit. They are explicitly  using that gesture for that reason, and  @voxdotcom  is clueless.
@neontaster  Seems "within realm of possibility" that that person missed the protesters who did purposefully copy.
@neontaster  However, I find it arrogant to try to make a connection. Most in Hong Kong don't know or give a crap of Ferguson. Rightfully.

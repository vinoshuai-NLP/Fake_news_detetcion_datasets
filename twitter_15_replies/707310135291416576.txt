@guypbenson  At this point it doesn't matter what he does, people are going to be offended. It's a lose lose situation.
@guypbenson  @DailyCaller  so pathetic we can never heal as a nation if POTUS keeps playing party politics
@guypbenson  how about you complain about something that is actually important.
@guypbenson  @EWErickson  neither of them would have gone to his funeral.  You mock him for being as small as your guys are
@guypbenson  @EWErickson  expect nothing less from an Alinskyite community agitator.
@guypbenson  @DailyCaller  He doesn't fit in with a "crowd with class" anyway.
@guypbenson  Of course, they were both White. No, he's not a racist!
@guypbenson  @matt_appleman  He's classless!
@guypbenson  You are aware that there's no tradition of POTUS attending the funeral of a past First Lady, right?
@WillMcAvoyACN  @guypbenson  how about for attending the funeral of a Supreme Court Justice?
@guypbenson  @DailyCaller  just like Bush skipped Ms Johnson's funeral. & she was from his home state. & that day his calneder was empty
@guypbenson  I happy he did what he felt.  He is sick of stretching out an olive branch to idiots.  Screw all of you.
@guypbenson  once again it's a no win situation for #POTUS he would get flack if he did attend too.  Let's face it you are racist. #enough
@guypbenson  You ppl need to get over yourselves.
@jdf0325  @serious_account  @WillMcAvoyACN  not a bad prognosis of Sanders and Trump either ;)
@guypbenson  Consideringhow corrupt both individuals were, howmuch damage they did2 this country & 2people, Iam QUITE RELIEVED hewon't Bthere

@denisleary  Ok she's a redneck Republican--but what's that got to do with cooking?

@denisleary : Paula Deen moves to have discrimination suit dismissed. Just in time for her new book "How To Cook A Jew" #itsfunnybcitsracist
@denisleary  I thought it was called "Cooking with the Klan"
@denisleary  Funny, I was told the new Paula Deen book was "Mick Mondays: 100 Favorite Potato Dishes"
@denisleary  Isn't it ironic that the meat from Jews isn't kosher?
@denisleary  I hope her recipe for Wop-Corn is in there.

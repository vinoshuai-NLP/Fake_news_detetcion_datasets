@marcyjcook  the main thing I'm worried about is people spreading a hoax more than the framing right now
@positronicwoman  @clovehitched Every single one of these people is probably already boycotting Target for some gay reason. Double boycott!
@TerrajaUW  @PositronicWoman  @CloveHitched They're regularly boycotting Target, for one reason or another, and it never caves.
@bkherbst11  You do know that harassing people in bathrooms is already illegal, right?
@bkherbst11  And that trans people are more likely to be assaulted in public bathrooms?
@bkherbst11  So why do anything that keeps women from using the women's room, then?
@PositronicWoman  @CloveHitched I now feel even more justified for how much I spend in Target every time I visit the US.
@PositronicWoman  @GeopLP  @USATODAY  Oh God I misread that article, I thought they WEREN't letting trans people in, my bad!
@PositronicWoman  @USATODAY  I know this makes me more likely to shop at  @Target .
@kat_the_grape  @marcyjcook  @PositronicWoman  Target for sure has earned my loyalty to them as a consumer.
@kat_the_grape  @PositronicWoman  That's great to hear!
@PositronicWoman  @genebalk  @USATODAY  Stand tall & proud,  @Target  I will make a pt of shopping with you
@PositronicWoman  @USATODAY  Let them boycott.Soon all major retailers will follow http://target.watch uptick in thrift store sales LMFAO
@PositronicWoman  @USATODAY   @Target  I will continue to shop and stand by Target. Thanks Target for doing right
@RightLife7  @PositronicWoman  @USATODAY  what word ISN'T made up? That's all words are!
@PositronicWoman  @USATODAY  I'm a trans man that used to work at Target, I tried to kill myself after my boss asked I not use the mens room.
@PositronicWoman  @USATODAY  She denied it and said she was "looking out for other employees" and the company is "transgender friendly'

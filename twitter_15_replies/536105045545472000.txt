@catrincooper  @LEGO_Group  @s8mb  @HFDSP  LOVE this :)
@catrincooper  @s8mb  @HFDSP  @glosswitch  How sad  @lego_group  seem to have forgotten who & what they were.
And yet  @catrincooper  @profhelenward  @LEGO_Group  @s8mb  @HFDSP
@mgtmccartney  @catrincooper  @LEGO_Group  @s8mb  @HFDSP  Yes.  And used to be for blocks for creativity, now mainly following instructions.
@catrincooper  @LEGO_Group  @s8mb  @HFDSP  that's fucking amazing.
@catrincooper  @Carnedraug  @LEGO_Group  @s8mb  @HFDSP  so what happened to that philosophy??? Return to fostering imagination LEGO,

@LineyD  @catrincooper  @LEGO_Group  @s8mb  @HFDSP  we've gone backwards since the 70s :-(

@catrincooper  @WildcatGear  @LEGO_Group  @s8mb  @HFDSP    Person that wrote that must have died/retired/been fired.
@johnnystorm  @catrincooper  @LEGO_Group  this mum buys her daughter the motorbike set and she loves it.
Exactly. No limit on who buys which sets.  “ @catrincooper : A letter from LEGO in the 1970s, boxed in with the toys ”
@OhMDee  @catrincooper  this is fake though.

@catrincooper  @klinkhart   @s8mb  @HFDSP  Unfortunately,  @LEGO_Group  has forgotten this philosophy...
@catrincooper  @anked  @LEGO_Group  @s8mb  @HFDSP  if only such letters were in boxes these days, too. Instead of the pink/purple hell for girls.
Brilliant via  @catrincooper  from  @LEGO_Group  in the 1970s   Pity LEGO now gears its products more twd boys than girls

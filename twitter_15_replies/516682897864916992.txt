@julipuli  @stroughtonsmith  @MacRumors  You can still get it, but the Time Machine UI is completely broken in Yosemite. It’s still on the
@julipuli  @stroughtonsmith  @MacRumors  disk.
@julipuli  @stroughtonsmith  @MacRumors  grabbing a demonstration screenshot right now give me a second.
@julipuli  @stroughtonsmith  It’s too long for a tweet, so I’ve made a CloudApp upload.  http://cl.ly/XmeW

@julipuli  aye, def. a problem, just wanted to note that Time Machine does back it all up, just doesn’t allow easy access to the data.

@MacRumors  This is a major problem considering how many of us are wiping devices for trade-in programs. Sign out of iCloud before wiping.
@MacRumors  @julipuli  bug: it also deletes some passwords (wifi etc.) on other iOS devices. After reset on iPad, iPhone forgot wifi passwords

@MacRumors  you can restore from time machine when using the public beta. I did it myself.
@MacRumors  when will I be able to connect to my ford SYNC again?
@MacRumors  this happened to me! & I only reset my iPad 2 settings because it was acting slow. Luckily everything backed up on iMac.

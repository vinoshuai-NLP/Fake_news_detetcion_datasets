@FastCompany  @CharlesGuice  Hell, I could have told you that.
@RonCowie  @FastCompany  Psst, me too.
@FastCompany  @deray  yep
@FastCompany  @deray  I'm actually impressed with how easily seemingly smart racists let their guard down and reveal how they feel.
Interesting article  @FastCompany  @deray , I also like this study why people are prejudiced: they’re less intelligent http://theglobeandmail.com/life/the-hot-button/study-links-low-intelligence-with-right-wing-beliefs/article543361/…
@FastCompany  @deray  huh, it's like a reverse Dunning-Kruger effect...
@FastCompany  NewVideo- Riding music   http://youtu.be/4AGF9NQbkkQ  From me and my Twin.   Tell me what u think
@FastCompany  water is wet
@FastCompany  they not stupid just ignorant and uncultured some stereotypes are horrendously outdated or apply to certain class levels only
@FastCompany  I think you're confusing smart with educated. Education may get u a job, but it'll never make u smart enough to deserve it.
@FastCompany  but it never statistically manifests in criminal violence so it the most special, unique form of identity hatred
@FastCompany  it can only be quantified by people who use it to elevate their own status,  and it never ebbs or resolves
@FastCompany  So true.
@FastCompany  @FinzHeatMarlins so meaning...all people are racist?
@FastCompany  Bullshit
@NeilFrick  @FastCompany  Certainly is!  Debate is dead.
@FastCompany  @BANYC_  SEEMS A BIT BIASED WITH THE CORRELATIVE QUESTIONS.  I STILL THINK RACISTS ARE DUMBER LOL.

@WhiteHouse  @USDOL  @POTUS  WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL THESE YEARS? WHY NOW? YOUR OVER REGULATION IS STIFLING ALL AMERICANS, WOMEN & MEN.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  So the obvious answer is more government control. As it is for every question, for #democrats
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  this isn't true, you know it's not true yet you continue to put it out there. The gap is closer to 96 or 97 cents
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  this is a liberal lie, prove it, show your data.
A question the  @WhiteHouse  won't answer: If employers could truly pay women 21% less for equal work, why would ANY employer EVER hire men?!?
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  and this administration hasn't paid women more.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  THIS IS NOT TRUE
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  LIES LIES LIES LIES. aggregate studies and lifestyle choices and again i feel like a "truther"...but yea fix your fiction
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  Does that include government employees? While you can't change how one negotiates their salary, you can be an example.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  For those of you here requesting data. http://lmgtfy.com/?q=wage+gap+data…
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  Not when job, education and tenure are factored in. Stop selling your lies to the ignorant masses.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  Ahem. This is still a lie.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  They make the same in each job. Comparing career choices is deceptive. More women need to choose stem majors then.
@MaryStewart01  @WhiteHouse  @POTUS  Not true. Even male nurses out-earn female nurses.
@WhiteHouse  @CTDems  @POTUS  Unacceptable. No second class citizen. Women are complimentary of men not inferior to them.
@WhiteHouse  @UN_Women  @POTUS  don't forget that this is only white women. WOC make significantly less than this.
@WhiteHouse  @UN_Women  @POTUS  black women make 64 to every mans dollar and Hispanic women make 54
@WhiteHouse  @UN_Women  @POTUS  It would be change very soon.
@farleyglobal  @WhiteHouse  @JessicaJanner  @POTUS  True. It's even less.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  No they don't. Your false stat compares all jobs, not the same job.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  Why do Obama and Hillary give this lip service but are every bit as guilty of this "pay disparity problem?"
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  And if a woman does not work, the man would pay $1.79
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  except for these 22 US cities, where women earn more than men
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  it's a real concern, but more info is needed. Link to study? I hope for more from our leadership than red meat tweets.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  Never worked for one of those companies.  All companies I have worked for have same pay rates for equal qualifications
@WhiteHouse  Please fix typo to read "Women." #WomenAreAlwaysWorking
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS   Woman want to be equal until there is something heavy to lift . when's the last time one of you changed the water jug???
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  my household wife 3 daughters wife & 1 daughter make much more then me 1 daughter makes same as me 1 a lot less WOM not
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS   Sooooooooo not cool.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  There is a serious wage disparity between men and women who work in the White House. Enough condescending please....
@farleyglobal  @WhiteHouse  @JessicaJanner  @POTUS  I'm an Obama supporter but this is misleading. When relevant factors are considered they're=
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  ALL MEN RUN Life WhatLearn fm QUEEN atHOME Don'tPAYEqual Y?“Time isAlwaysRIGHT todo Whatis RIGHT”

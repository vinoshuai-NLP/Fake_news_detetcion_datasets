@LKrauss1  One off Big Bang (theory?) propositions are ridiculous  @raymondadkins
@LKrauss1  Without supernatural themes, Catholic is like communism :)
Duck and Cover! RT  @yok_the_evil :  @LKrauss1  Without supernatural themes, Catholic is like communism :)
@LKrauss1  Of course the real point to make is that nature knows no authority: it doesn't care what the pope, nor you or I, believe is true.

@dr_ikjyotsinghk  @LKrauss1  Fallacy? Bringing philosophy into science much?

@fourth85 I suggest you go back to school and learn how to form a proper sentence.
@LKrauss1  Dude...he tried...all show maybe...but small steps for primates...remember ?...not going anywhere...granted...

@nickpistor  @stltoday  @ChristineDByers  sure Che was not pAid!! What ever!!
@nickpistor  @goldietaylor  @ChristineDByers  Like he's to be believed.
@nickpistor  @WesleyLowery  @ChristineDByers  yea because he's credible all of the sudden, not that ABC is either but they're free to deny this
@nickpistor  @Green_Footballs  @ChristineDByers  not directly that doesn't mean he didn't receive some kinda financial benefit from interview
@nickpistor  @WesleyLowery  @ChristineDByers  This former tv newser knows: they have their ways
@nickpistor  @WesleyLowery  @ChristineDByers  I don't believe that...!!
@nickpistor  @ChristineDByers  If enough people stop paying taxes, he won't be able to fund amnesty. #stoppayingtaxes.
@nickpistor  @goldietaylor  @ChristineDByers  And we all know Darren Wilson doesn't lie - yeah right.
@nickpistor  @Yamiche  @ChristineDByers  Bet the Browns can't say the same!Raking in the money!
@nickpistor     the Time Person of the year should be DeAndre Joshua, grand jury witness shot dead for telling the truth  #Ferguson
@nickpistor  @RaisingOneBrow  @ChristineDByers  maybe it went to a trust? #semantics #bookadvance
Credible source “ @nickpistor : Darren Wilson told the Post-Dispatch that he was not paid for the ABC News interview...”
@nickpistor  Oh, so we expect the bastard that has lied about EVERYTHING to now tell the truth.   @MTmarilyn2  @ChristineDByers
@nickpistor  @Green_Footballs  @ChristineDByers  what's another lie on top of a blown out eye socket? Maybe his agent got paid? #technicality
@nickpistor  @WesleyLowery  @ChristineDByers  Darren Wilson doesn't have to worry about money.He'll undoubtedly get much from extremists. C'MON

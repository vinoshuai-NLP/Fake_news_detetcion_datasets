@CBCNews  why are we killing ppl in the middle east for American political gain, making us a ripe target for his kind of revenge attack
@CBCNews  stay safe
@KarlaSolano1525 yes it's awful. Police are still looking for another suspect & that's disconcerting. Ppl are still in lock down in bldgs
@KarlaSolano1525 yes I'm ok. I live on the other side of the country. As of now I believe there hasn't been any further shootings
@KarlaSolano1525 me too. Scary to think there may be a violent suspect still out there
@CBCNews  @strombo  My heart breaks for that soldier's family and friends. #OttawaShooting
@CBCNews  @strombo  I only wonder why shoot the gunman down & kill him vs interrogation? Is there more like him or was this a solo vendetta?
So Sad :( #OttawaShooting  @CBCNews   #StaySafeOttawa  #togethertntstrong
@CBCNews  @strombo  so sad what's happened to #Canada :(

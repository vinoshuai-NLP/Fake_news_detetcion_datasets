@nprpolitics  @NPR  she should know from polluting water in Arkansas
@nprpolitics  Wait until they hear about WASHINGTON, DC's water crisis! Lead in the water, but citizens DON'T KNOW! #FlintWaterCrisis in DC!
@nprpolitics  @NPR  No one cares.
@nprpolitics  @NPR  -I can tell U there are increased lead levels in every State -Check health Dept stats!!
@mjbj19  @NPR  it's not just the government it's the entire system of power and control. Gov is only a part of the wider problem. Think bigger
@nprpolitics  @NPR  but didn't call for his resignation
@nprpolitics  We didn't need Hillary to remind us to be outraged...but it was nice political gaming from a professional politician.
@nprpolitics  @NPR  Time for a recall of the governor and maybe jail sentences for those who were criminally negligent & poisoned citizens.
@nprpolitics  this is an infrastructure problem - corrosion - old lead pipes.
@nprpolitics  @NPR  I have been outraged for some time
@mjbj19  @NPR  lol no I'm more of a point out the flaws and hope we can all work together to make things better kind of person :)
@nprpolitics  @NPR  how about Benghazi?
@mjbj19  @NPR  yes if government were the end of the story then limiting their influence would be a solution but they're not so it isn't.
@nprpolitics  @NPR  @  @HillaryClinton  So why didn't the Dem mayor of Flint do something about it?
@nprpolitics  @NPR  "They came for my neighbor and I did not speak out, then they came for me and no one spoke out."  We are all next. SPEAK!
@nprpolitics  @SensesFail  Bernie is the only one who spoke out and called for the Governor's resignation. Clinton stayed silent until last n.

@BadAstronomer  GRAVITY DOES NOT WORK THAT WAY
@BadAstronomer  Can you give us a better hint? What do you mean "no"? No, as in "No doubt that we WILL be able to float"?
@BadAstronomer  More importantly, even if the gravity were greater than 9.8 the Earth would experience it as well
@BadAstronomer  Then someone will argue that you cannot know for sure until the day comes so at best you can only be a floating 'agnostic'.
“ @BadAstronomer : Will you be able to float on Jan. 4, 2015, aka Zero G Day?   Hint: No.  http://slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/12/24/zero_g_day_nope.html… ” DARN
@BadAstronomer  Wait.. what? That's a thing? LOL
@BadAstronomer  i wonder who starts these whacky rumors, and why. are they profiting? are they trolling? are they just confused?
@BadAstronomer  It would be scary if somehow gravity could just be turned off.
@BadAstronomer  it's a shame schools don't emphasize critical thinking but religion would be in big trouble if they did.
@BadAstronomer  I can float any time I want! All I need is a sufficiently large body of water.
@BadAstronomer  Sigh... Go ahead and bust another one of our balloons, just like  @scalzi
@BadAstronomer  b...but social media is telling me I can! Next thing you're gonna be telling us, we won't be riding hoverboards next summer.
@BadAstronomer  Wouldn't an actual Zero G day be really bad? Turning off the one thing that keeps Earth together kind of bad?
@BadAstronomer  the debunking was superb!
@BadAstronomer  planet earth needs more like you! Hats off 
@BadAstronomer  Not with THAT attitude
@BadAstronomer  if there's no gravity, her dress and hair wouldn't fall down
@BadAstronomer  I'll certainly be able to float, but I have a feeling it will have more to do with a fair amount of single malt whisky
@BadAstronomer  "the placebo effect", works wonders on the mind.
@BadAstronomer  are you planning to be in orbit or the vommit comet? No? Then no.
@BadAstronomer  Perhaps on May the 4th.
@BadAstronomer  The hoaxers put in the effort of making a fake tweet, but didn't bother checking to see if it was under 140 characters?
@BadAstronomer  This is sooooo sad. sigh.
@BadAstronomer  LOVE the Hint.
@BadAstronomer  We ALL float down here.
@BadAstronomer  @StarTalkRadio  What if the air has a high salt content?
@BadAstronomer  saw a post claiming this on tumblr and linked to your article I debunk   good to have
@BadAstronomer  It always amazes me what people will believe. Did they just completely sleep their way through school??

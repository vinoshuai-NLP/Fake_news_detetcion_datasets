@jwk2506  @espn
did u say second round
Conor McGregor def. Nate Diaz via majority decision (48-47, 48-47, 47-47). I had Nate winning rounds 2,3 and 5. #UFC202
fuck this , rigged! #3 right  @ufc  ? More money
booooooooooooo!
he for sure didn't do that.
conor won bitches he punished him 1 2 leg kicks lets go!!!
made the most of it running
UFC is all about the money. Fight three will be in 6-10 months.
by running away?
Diaz won 3/4/5 rounds and the takedown at the end. Fix company bs only in for the money.  Diaz won kept pressure in the 5th
rigged simple as that
that was bs nate beat his ass in the championship rounds
landed shots or are ppl blind lol
he deserved that L tho not the W
He dropped him just striking twice, but didn't want to go to the ground. Did you watch?
he got beat
Just stop. He didn't make the most of it. The only way he realistically comes out of this on top is a stoppage.   Delete your account.
all respect to him, but he survived it. We all saw the gas get real low again. He's shown everyone his Achilles heel.
nate Diaz made an excuse cause he knew he lost
#ufc has turned into boxing now. Cater to the money and hype. 3rd fight now and the sheep will buy. Floyd already did this.
"barely survived" * knocked Diaz down 3 times and let him get up those 3 times*
@TheNotoriousMMA  had to pull out his best effort he's ever given tonight
we need a third fight Nate got robbed
kobe definitely a top 25 player all time, for sure
Land almost 100 less punches and win. Interesting concept....
he was runnin when the going got tough.. Was gifted that decision
who the win?
@TheMikeOMalley  Draw at best. Trilogy makes $$$$.
#LBJ #GOAT
Connor's coach tells him he loses two straight and anyone with a brain can tell Diaz won 5. How the fuck Connor still fucking win?
fixed fixed fight... Now  @TheNotoriousMMA  is running back to his weight class, and  @danawhite  gets the win he wanted
Congratulation to Conor McGregor on his win tonight against a good fighter in Nate Diaz. Give them a few more rounds. #GreatFight  @espn
Nate didn't even drop Connor. Both did well but this one goes to  @TheNotoriousMMA
two top competitors going balls to the wall. MMA is what boxing used to be. #UFC202

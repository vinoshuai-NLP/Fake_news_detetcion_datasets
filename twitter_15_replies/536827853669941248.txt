@alawevans  @Independent  depressingly I think my daughter has some pink Lego, on the plus side she does want me to make her a space ship.
@Independent  So true, Well done Lego!
. @Independent  @MPeadon  Huh, guess it was only later they became ragingly sexist
@AyaReina  they developed their business as we see it now bc it was profitable. Smaller sets, increased characters = more $
@lillai23  @Independent  @hellbentarmour  @LEGO_Group  I don't think they existed back in the 70's - I think Lego was all the same back then.
@lillai23  @Independent  @hellbentarmour  @LEGO_Group  sad to hear - the beauty was that no creative decisions were made for the kids.
@RJCBennett  @lillai23  @Independent  @LEGO_Group  Maybe they need to go back and re trace their own decisions?
@Independent  @albericie  # We had no money Dad made wooden bows or home made cricket bats & we all pretended we were space men or John Wayne
@Independent  @albericie  #  my imagination world helped me to pretend I was  elsewhere or some one else when  frightened by violent drunks .
@lillai23  @RJCBennett  @Independent  @LEGO_Group  The targeting aside, isn't it a good way to learn patience and logic; following instructions?
@lillai23  @RJCBennett  @Independent  @LEGO_Group  I agree some are too rigid and the girl targeted ones are too easy.
@philosophiephil  @lillai23  @RJCBennett  @Independent  @LEGO_Group  My nephew aswell, I'm super impressed with that.
@lillai23  @RJCBennett  @Independent  @LEGO_Group  It does & when we are kids, imagination should've few or no limits. Get plenty of that later
@philosophiephil  @lillai23  @RJCBennett  It's actually the same with halloween; pre made costumes instead of making your own.
@philosophiephil  @lillai23  @RJCBennett  I agree, but we are limited. Panopticon.
. @Independent . The urge to create is equally strong in every child -  boy or girl. Why is the fact lost to schools and administrators?
@philosophiephil  @lillai23  @RJCBennett  Originally a prison design but works in theory for society aswell, you feel watched thus "behave".

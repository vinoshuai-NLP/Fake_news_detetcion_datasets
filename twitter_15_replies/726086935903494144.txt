@chuckwoolery  Didn't sign the boycott pledge but I seldom shop at Target.
@chuckwoolery  Target stock is up over $11 since February.
@muffley_merkin  @chuckwoolery  But it's down a couple bucks since this hit the news. That, of course, is what is relevant here
@chuckwoolery  @BreitbartNews  even better news. George Soros owns Target stock
@donnaword  @chuckwoolery  @BreitbartNews  Of course he does. He needs to meet his maker already. #BoycottTarget
@chuckwoolery  @BreitbartNews  I am willing to bet they knew this would happen and are waiting for Americans' poor attention span to shift.
@chuckwoolery  @scoutgosha The folks who run Target are Progressives, but even Progressive executives have to answer to angry shareholders.
@chuckwoolery  I'd join, but I don't generally shop their to begin with. Maybe ~$200 last year? And I live right next to one.
@chuckwoolery  @WandaHoward1971 Ppl need to also email and phone their headquarters and let them know how disgusted that are!
@chuckwoolery  I wonder which toilet they used to flush the money down?
@chuckwoolery  @BreitbartNews   Hey Target! Want to know where that logo is? On you!  #boycotttarget
@chuckwoolery  hope it continues to 5 million!
@chuckwoolery  @Rene_gadeCowboy  #WeThePeople CAN make a difference if we UNITE! Now let's get on with voting 2 #SaveUSA!
@chuckwoolery  I will NEVER shop there again!
@chuckwoolery  @BreitbartNews  ...hopefully Target will wake up & realize the percentage of common sense folks out weigh the nonsense!
@chuckwoolery  Sorry Target but, being inclusive means no discrimination in hiring or product offerings. Not sausage in the ladies restroom.
@chuckwoolery  lets go on up to 2 million and see if they decide men should be men and women should be women! #targetboycott

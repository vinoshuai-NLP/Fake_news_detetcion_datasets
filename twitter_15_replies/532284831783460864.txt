“ @Chris_Meloni :  @nypost  word” - how come chick isn't on this insane list? Lol
@nypost  gnarly.
@nypost  AWESOME.
@jackgoesforth  @MChaseRadio  @nypost  I think the original list came from a teacher somewhere?
@nypost  there's someone who needs heavy slapping!
@nypost  dog , this ain't "teen" talk, it's how we all talk duuuh..eric you gotta chill, like for real
@nypost  @coyabro302
@nypost  Awesome!! I get turned off by thugspeak!! I want to hear good, intelligent speech.
@nypost  lmao
@jackgoesforth   Should the list say "turnt up?" Typos dilute the effect.
@todd_allen  @jackgoesforth  I hear "turnt" over here - without the "up" - and, "so hype".....
@nypost  I don't see any curse words on the list so what's the problem? Give me a "fongool" and then I understand. As my grandson says, chill
@nypost  HA I tell my sons all the time, "this is why we seek higher education boys."
@nypost  what an asshead.
@jackgoesforth  @dmblanning  Just don't say bae! (This is implied.)
@todd_allen  @jackgoesforth  truth be told, if I say any of these, my children laugh hysterically. Lately, the only time they are unified.

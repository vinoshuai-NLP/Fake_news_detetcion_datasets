@TwitchyTeam  @im4tech73h  "accused of beheading one woman, who was pronounced dead at the scene" Something about that sentence...
@CallowJ  @CalkinsMark  @TwitchyTeam  Agreed, but...any rigid ideology (inc liberalism)  that refuses the right to disagree has the potential.
@CallowJ  @CalkinsMark  @TwitchyTeam  Because once you decide your way is the ONLY permissible way to think...you start trying to enforce that.
@TwitchyTeam  @RONBI    Behead the bastard
@CallowJ  @CalkinsMark  @TwitchyTeam  Has DHS put those signs next to ones at the border warning people to stay away? http://examiner.com/article/arizona-warns-residents-with-signs-against-hiking-region-near-mexico-border…
@Merleliz  @CallowJ  @CalkinsMark  @TwitchyTeam  WE HAVE NO RIGHTS .
Weirdo. RT  @TwitchyTeam  Photo released of suspect Alton Nolen in Moore, Okla. beheading. http://twitchy.com/2014/09/26/breaking-woman-beheaded-in-oklahoma/…
@TwitchyTeam  Imagine if a white man had beheaded a black woman, Oh the outcry and riots that would occur.
@TwitchyTeam  DNC's  @DWStweets  says worse things about Scott Walker & Rick Scott than the liberal media will even admit about Alton Nolen.
@TwitchyTeam  @prfekrdumbrella  I'll just bet the women he attacked were white. But if the DOJ is involved it's work place violence.
@CallowJ  @TwitchyTeam  @CalkinsMark  criminals with easy access to a devastatingly effective tool.
@CallowJ  @CommieJuice  @CalkinsMark  Name 1 time in the last 300 years when the government tried to kill an American citizen.
@CallowJ  @CommieJuice  @CalkinsMark  so I should be directing my attention to banning drones?
@banjopicker1605  @TwitchyTeam  Haha. Haven't heard that in forever. Thanks for the nostalgia!
@TwitchyTeam  @mkues65  Coward attacks women.

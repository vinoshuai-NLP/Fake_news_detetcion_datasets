@CNN  oh just shut the Fuck up, aborted que ball! She had balls to full off such an stunt on live TV! Not that I support her cause! Still!
@CNN  she had enough lol!!
@CNN  praise for  @alexisreporter , KTVA director: Great poise given cursing coworker's Live ambush. With news platform comes responsibility.

@CNN  
@CNN  what a way to say good by...
@CNN  it made her look unprofessional ,erratic  and kind of crazy. not good all around
@CNN  Televsion news is a joke anyhow. What kind of person actually watches that crap?
@CNN  Yawnnnn...
@CNN  she had to have won the lottery. That's the only way you can quit like that...lol
@CNN  and I bet you wouldn't hire her now.
@CNN  she's a living legend
“ @CNN : Well, this is one way to quit your job. Watch Alaskan reporter Charlo Green quit live on air." What a way to quit a job...
@CNN  well she will probably never work again. Employers are well connected to the media platform
@CNN  She'll never get another on air job again!
@CNN  like a bawse!!
@CNN  The delivery was arguably inappropriate, but I admire her zeal. The response of the Anchorwoman was absolutely  #Priceless.

@CNN  Now it's going to be hard for black people to get reporting jobs in Alaska. Disgrace! Could have done it in a better way.

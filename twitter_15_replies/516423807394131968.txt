@AbbyMartin  that's amazing. shows the power of social media interconnected society. #itsasmallworldafterall #Ferguson
@AbbyMartin  There may be hope for us yet!
@AbbyMartin  to bad its not happening in Beijing
@AbbyMartin  what is beautiful about a protest? Things will get worse ... ppl must learn from others... patience is a virtue , indeed.
@AbbyMartin  a Jewish X soldier said that Israel will be selling the world all these dangerous things and he was right
@AbbyMartin  beautiful planet connection!
@AbbyMartin  doubt the gesture is about #Ferguson at all. HK youths are protesting against ML economic oppression, in the streets in droves.
@AbbyMartin  Thanks for sharing that. You're featured on my  @RebelMouse  http://rbl.ms/1ouRfXK
@AbbyMartin  @algator2   In Gaza and Ferguson this didn't work!
@AbbyMartin  @maggicarter  I am sure this has been done before and the Hong Kong students have more on mind that Ferguson . Not detracting
RT  @AbbyMartin  Beautiful global solidarity in #HongKong ...marching with "hands up, don't shoot" gesture #Ferguson
@AbbyMartin  @snarkylicious  Maybe this can proved a false image, but for now I choose to believe there's solidarity in our joint struggle.
@AbbyMartin  @Ian56789  Luckily in #HongKong not #Ferguson where they'd probably be gassed or shot! US #Democracy isn't kind to #demonstrators
@AbbyMartin  @BarbaraRansby  The International dimensions of the black freedom struggle are ever present.

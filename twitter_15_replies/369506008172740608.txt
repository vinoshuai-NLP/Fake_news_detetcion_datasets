“ @MikkoAlanne : Fukushima nuke plant leaking 300 tons of radioactive water in Pacific everyday: http://tnat.in/o3VSE” #NOTHINGTOSEEHERE
@MikkoAlanne  @GreatDismal  is 300 tons less than 300 000 litres ?
@pauljarvis  @MikkoAlanne  @GreatDismal  And so why are they using tons instead of litres considering water ? #Manipulation ?
@MikkoAlanne  @GreatDismal  If that water was 100% radioactive (it's not) it's only 0.0000000000163600288600289% of the ocean Unmeasurable.
@MikkoAlanne  @thenation  A DAY?! My goodness not only is the marine life in danger but what about people who come into contact with this?!
@MikkoAlanne  @thenation  Or the fish being exposed to this that are consumed by people?

@MikkoAlanne  @GreatDismal  at least 50,000,000 tons of CO2 leaking into the air every day. Since 1990.
@MikkoAlanne  @GreatDismal  BP cares.

@MikkoAlanne  @junkyardmessiah  .@ Wasn't that a Debbie Boone song? "You light Up My Life?" R there no international controls?
@MikkoAlanne  dont buy any tinned fish from the pacific boycott it.
@MikkoAlanne  @rositastef  They say only level 1 ie lowest! How can this be lowest!!!
@GraceMurphy2  @MikkoAlanne  Media, very quiet about this. Probably because there is nothing that can be done! This is polluting ALL of us

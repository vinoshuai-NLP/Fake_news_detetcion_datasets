@SCClemons  @Donna_West  @ACTED  what the hell is up with these basterds beheading everyone?
@SCClemons  @wikijeff  @ACTED  He is the 3rd Occidental to be beheaded so far. We must add the 2 Lebenase soldiers who got the same treatment.
@SCClemons  @husainhaqqani  highly brutal act. Murderers must be punished. Sympathies with family
@SCClemons  @husainhaqqani  @ACTED  sad!
@SCClemons  Congrats on your 250★ tweet! http://favstar.fm/t/510921017972514817…
@SCClemons  @ACTED  so sad for the loved ones he left behind. The world knows he tried to make it a better place for the suffering. #brave
@SCClemons  @ACTED  wtf is #ISIS where the bloodyhell they came from ??
@SCClemons  @husainhaqqani  @ACTED   Sincere condolences and apologoies for this barbaric act inflicted on someone who seems totally innocent.
@SCClemons  @ACTED #Time to close the Islamic threat from within Europe.Muslims sit in 2sides of the fence.Condemn atrocities yet preach it.
@SCClemons  @mehdirhasan  @ACTED  UK Muslims in almost unanimous condemnation of killing of aid workers & journalists, & all innocent people
@SCClemons  @RizMokal  America discards Iran's crucial participation in ousting this terrorist entity. Too late, Iran is already involved.....
@SCClemons  @RizMokal  Without Iran there's no hope of eradicating the Islamic State. Iran must be recognised as a key global player.
@SCClemons  @vausecnn  @ACTED  They are so cruel....evil possessed people. May GOD wrath fall upon them in no time!
@SCClemons  @Mathidiot  @ACTED  Heartbreaking.
@SCClemons  @ACTED   Does the  @CIA / other western spy orgs use aid workers as agents? An honest answer please. If so they share blame equally
@GreatHeretic  Murdered David Haines was a aid worker and had been for the last 15 years. He was our colleague. He was a humanitarian.
@Ra_nialily  I don't do this: http://barracudabrigade.blogspot.co.uk/2014/08/syria-more-beheadings-by-savages-of.html?m=1… NOW, FUCK OFF
@SCClemons  @ACTED  Please #RT our campaign to show that #ISIS do not represent British Muslims #NotInMyName  http://youtu.be/wfYanI-zJes
@Ra_nialily You have a better explanation for extreme violence, intolerance, terrorism & misogyny in the Muslim world?
@Ra_nialily Know many & reading Quran now to better understand the radicalism that worries my MUSLIM friends.
@Ra_nialily  @ChrisMusForum  The powers at be then have a funny way of showing it

@islamisbeauty14  @DailyMirror  but do nothing
@SmillingHK  @DailyMirror  idk. I don't think I could be that cool about it. Maybe the Spirit gives them peace for their righteous courage.
@DailyMirror  Take this picture down, what are you playing at? Might as well take out an ISIS membership. You are giving them what they want.
@SmillingHK That wouldn't surprise me in the least.  Sickening, but not surprising.  @DailyMirror

@WhiteHouse  Actually, responsibility come with paying the bill... #Dumbass
@WhiteHouse    TWO+DOORS in life: (1) Your Dream, passion & Career! Astrophysicist, lawyer, Dr? (2) YOUR BACKUP!  2 YR COLLEGE,1ST STEP TO#1!
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS , access to a higher education is the number #`1 priority for generations to come for my grandchildren. It all starts #now
@WhiteHouse  why put stipulations on it, anybody wanting to learn at a CC is a responsible student. Make it free, sans conditions.
@SeanMeeh42  @WhiteHouse  let's see the stats on responsible students?
@WhiteHouse   nice plan i hope same plan are apply mr. P.M Modi sir mr.obama india have more talented student but india not used talent
@WhiteHouse  so, POTUS will be voting for #BernieSanders  http://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-education/#college-tuitionâ€¦
@WhiteHouse  this is india talented student.
@WhiteHouse  free with my money. That's how my kids live. Now I'm going to pay for everyone's!
@WhiteHouse  who pays for this? How many billions will Taxes be raised?
@WhiteHouse
@WhiteHouse  And who pays for it?
@WhiteHouse  why not make K-12 work first. Why add 13-14. More bad doesn't make good.
@WhiteHouse  Why does college take so long?  Can't breaks be shortened and college time compressed (energy savings, student savings)?
@WhiteHouse  oh yes!
@WhiteHouse  When a politician says, "free" it actually means, taxpayer funded. #WakeUpAmerica
@WhiteHouse  cheaper for me to pay for my kids once than everyone else's forever. No thank you
@WhiteHouse  responsible students don't need free college HENCE THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE. Liberals 
@WhiteHouse   Why is Marijuana a class #1 narcotic?
@WhiteHouse  sounds good
@WhiteHouse  @FoxNews  @oreillyfactor  @CNN  does this mean you'll knock two years off my student loan?
@WhiteHouse  Define responsible.
@WhiteHouse  get us all dependent on  government. Not even shy about it anymore.
@WhiteHouse  why not all students?
@WhiteHouse  Define "responsible"
@WhiteHouse  this kinda makes sense in some fields but not all if there are no jobs for some degrees then they should not be free
@WhiteHouse  terrible idea
@WhiteHouse  $3.8K? That is not what DOEd says.  Av. public tuition is ~$6K, private non-prof is ~$30K, private for-prof ~$14K.
@WhiteHouse  That averages $16,519 tuition across all types. 17.3 million new enrollments est., so for two years that's ~$572B total,
@WhiteHouse  Who's gonna pay for it? Nothing is actually free, pay now or pay later.
@WhiteHouse  could you please define the word "free" please.

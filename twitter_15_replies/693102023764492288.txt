@BBCBreaking  @BBCWorld  :Must be punished and made an example for other idiots who may follow her
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  let them go and never let them return. Bye!!!
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Guilty. Deport her. She gave up the values of this country so why should she continue to live here?

@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  @bbc5live  @BBCRadio4  - not cool, certainly not utopia over there at present! Disenchanted? Why not try else-where!
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  How dare you call this mother a UK mother. She is Syrian with a British passport. There is nothing British about her.
@BBCBreaking  @annie6256  BBCNews
@greenhalgh_lee  @BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  it's not about what I think. What I'm saying is there's no law stating that it's illegal.
@Mercia123St  @BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  I'm no racist. You on the other hand most likely are.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  effing idiot. She should have stayed in Syria. Disillusioned idiot. #imamuslim #hateisis #idiots #cowards
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  i really dont get this ??? so many people risk their life  and die to come here and she took her son there #crazy
@BBCBreaking  @SpecialKMB1969  @BBCNews  Let her goâ€¦ However, she is not welcome back anywhere in the Western world.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCWorld  @BBCNews  She holds no British culture, values or desires to keep Britain Great. A truly unneeded attendant in GB!
@BBCBreaking  @bbc5live  @BBCNews  #ignoranceisnotblissforothers #blindleadtheblind

@BBCBreaking  Wait until they meet Allah~ Huge surprise~
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Ridiculously she has also been found guilty of encouraging acts of terrorism through messages posted on Twitter.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  she has realised she made a mistake. Realised she can't claim benefits for herself or child. No NHS, housing.. Treason
@BBCBreaking  Leading Saudi cleric says IS and Saudi Arabia 'follow the same thought'
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  remove her passport, council house and benefits and get rid of her and her cronies

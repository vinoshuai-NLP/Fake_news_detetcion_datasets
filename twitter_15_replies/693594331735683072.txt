@WhiteHouse  전국에 운영중인 보건소를 읍면 도서벽지까지 확대 및 시설을 확장하고 이에 따른 예산은 전액 국가운영 건강보험공단 의 재정으로 지원한다. 일반약품만 지원하는 보건소에 근무할 종사자는 의학전문가가 아닌 상식적인 생활과학 지식수준의
@WhiteHouse  교육으로 충분하므로 고교졸업 이상으로 충분하다. 따라서 보건소는 1차 진료로 지정하고 신체 수술이나 응급환자, 부상치료 환자는 2차인 병.의원으로 지정한다. 보건소의 환자치료로 인한 순수 이익금은 국가운영 복지재단으로 이월하여
@WhiteHouse  목적사업에 활용한다. 아울러 이 제도를 도입하고자 하는 국가에 질병과 노화예방에 대한 저렴하고 쉽고 안전한 해결법을 전수할 수 있슴.

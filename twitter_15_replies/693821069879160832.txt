@espn  @OTLonESPN  ...not surprised---and they are not alone!!!
@espn  @davidubben  @OTLonESPN  As a Baylor alum, this makes me mad. Not that yall wrote this, but that there was something to write about.
@mdwilliams1988  @espn  @davidubben  @OTLonESPN  I believe releasing it the weekend before signing day was a calculated attack from ESPN.
@espn  @OTLonESPN  Everyone should watch this video, some crazy stuff going on at Baylor
@espn  @davidubben  @OTLonESPN  Absolutely sad.  Feel so bad for the victims and their parents.
@espn  @OTLonESPN  sadly, I don't think this is just a Baylor problem. All universities have to be better when handling rape accusations.
@connor_mighell @Frehndry1426 I should have phrased my question different. Connor didn't do anything wrong.
@connor_mighell  @OurDailyBears  @SeanMcDGC23  it does? Noone does it better than OTL. Baylor leaders silence also says a lot. Shameful.
@mstang1970  @connor_mighell  @OurDailyBears  @SeanMcDGC23  as a student, I can say a lot of this information is misleading.
@connor_mighell  @mstang1970  @OurDailyBears  @SeanMcDGC23  leaders won't speak about it. Says it all. They know the school acted disgracefully.
@espn  @TexasNextUp  @OTLonESPN  Is someone going to Investigate Baylor besides Baylor?
@connor_mighell  @mstang1970  @OurDailyBears  @SeanMcDGC23  I was in a very mentally dangerous situation and Baylor counseling wouldn't see...
@connor_mighell  @mstang1970  @OurDailyBears  @SeanMcDGC23  me 4 a week. Not their fault. Unfortunately, too many people in similar circumstance
@connor_mighell  @mstang1970  @OurDailyBears  @SeanMcDGC23  gave me a hotline #. Sure they did the same for her. Guess that doesn't count tho
@espn  @davidubben  @OTLonESPN  coincidence before NSD? Other than graphic detail, all old news! What abt improvement since TitleIX ofc created
@espn  @OTLonESPN  se√±ores no se trata de cambiar uniformes,y peor ese uniforme alterno color azul,se trata de que cambien su manera de juego.
@espn  @OTLonESPN  @BellaRican_Kira
@espn  @OTLonESPN  @PeterCmffl  @The12thmanJDH more BAYLIARS coverup.
@espn  @davidubben  Might be a good opportunity to ask Art Briles some hard questions at his NSD press conf this week.

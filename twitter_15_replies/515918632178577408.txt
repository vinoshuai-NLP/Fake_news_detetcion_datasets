@DavidNelsonNews  I believe that has been refuted by her family.
. @DavidNelsonNews  @pjhnsn8  Ancient odd beliefs keep every1 down. Dare to believe in what is in ur heart.
@DavidNelsonNews  @RosaTrunk  she killed innocent children and women in cold blood!! She's killer!!
@RashaAtef129  @DavidNelsonNews  @RosaTrunk  huh?? Can you say "propaganda"?
@DavidNelsonNews  @adam_zander  The family does not deserve to have somebody as fine as she is to be part of it. She is a hero in my book.
@DavidNelsonNews  @marcylauren  What exactly did they think she would be doing when she flew fighter jets?
@DavidNelsonNews  @marcylauren  She was never "owned" to begin with. If her family "disowns" her for this...It's their loss.
bottom line ISLAM SUCKS  @DavidNelsonNews  @marcylauren
@DavidNelsonNews  She's better off without them. Pray she stays strong.
@DavidNelsonNews  @Lamarche  ..this was made up check your facts.
@DavidNelsonNews  @Really_AgainWhy  Interesting article.
@DavidNelsonNews  that's not true, her family is very proud. #مريم_المنصوري #uae #Dailymail 
@Saeed_Hajeri  I hope a counter-story is published ASAP.  @DavidNelsonNews
@DavidNelsonNews  @MYarr  notfair
@DavidNelsonNews  @MYarr  please read the kantian theory and Gods law though shall not kill"""
@DavidNelsonNews  - Cowardly parents. Shameful. Mariam is a heroine to all young western and muslim girls. As a woman, I am very proud of you
@DavidNelsonNews  @freehawk  welp we see the only smart one in the family
@DavidNelsonNews   SHAME ON HER FAMILY THAT WOMAN IS A BONA FIDE HERO!
@DavidNelsonNews  With family like that, she should treat them like an ISIS training camp & bombs away!
@DavidNelsonNews  @elvislver56  She is now Part of My Family, WELCOME Fighter Pilot Al Mansouri!!!!!!!
@DavidNelsonNews  @rjoseph7777  I'm not surprised if correct; personally I think its great
@DavidNelsonNews  @Dowens8490  We welcome her to our family.
@DavidNelsonNews   Western parents disown kids a lot actually Usually it's non-acceptance of their sexuality, or choice of marriage partners.
@DavidNelsonNews  @RdcvolanoRoger  Seriously folks! & this is what r own home grown #GOPer Conservatives think of Her & Females in general!
@DavidNelsonNews  @neilpX  the article makes clear that the "letter" was published anonymously & they don't even know if it's real or not.
@DavidNelsonNews  I think her family is on drugs. At least she achieved her brethren couldn't hiding behind veil.
@DavidNelsonNews  @mazakry  Well her so called family is part of the problem. Says it all, muslims wont stand against their own murdering mob.
@DavidNelsonNews  I'll adopt her.
@DavidNelsonNews  @FirstMate1060  good news is, the other 95% of the world thinks she is a hero
@DavidNelsonNews  @FirstMate1060  But not by the people she is protecting! Stand strong! !!! We are proud of you always.
@DavidNelsonNews  @FirstMate1060  I will take her any day ! keep bombing them !
@DavidNelsonNews  Screw them! She can come live with me!!
@DavidNelsonNews  @FirstMate1060  Very complex. As we saw in Vietnam, Northern Ireland etc one man's hated enemy is another's freedom fighter.
@DavidNelsonNews   Mensouri family did refute the communique with numbers of Tweets according el-Watan: http://elwatannews.com/news/details/566213…
@DavidNelsonNews  @FirstMate1060  Hell we will claim her.
@DavidNelsonNews  I think she is strong. Keep bombing evil.
@DavidNelsonNews  @Liberty4UanMe  INGRATE FAMILY DOESN'T DESERVE HER BRAVE SOUL. She has a new family now in civilized world that values peace
@DavidNelsonNews  Why is she abandoned by her family? Don't understand it. Please respond.

@Davos  And they die young of exhaustion?
@Davos  They write down things they are grateful for. Need to start doing that. Great idea regardless.
"Work on a personal-passion project". RT 14 things successful people do before breakfast  @Davos
@Davos  take a piss ,bath,May be brush ,and I mean who made this list
@Davos  They ruthlessly delete pathetic shit like this.
@Davos  - this and other tripe such as 'what the most successful people do on the weekend' available on Amazon now!
@Davos  mhm yep ok
why 14. is it because 15 is jacking off and you can't say that at  @Davos
@fearwig  @maetilda  @Davos  I'm interested to meet someone who doesn't wake up before breakfast.
. @Davos  Sounds just like a typical morning at PMHQ, although we also try to make time to dialogue with our hotdesk teams during Yoga break.
@Davos  Loosers. I do all of these - and a lot more - before I even wake up.
@SamGion  @Davos  in your dream in your dreams
@Davos  What about taking a poo?
@therealelp  @Davos  Is that before or after you make your bed?
@therealelp  @Davos  I just assumed this was what #5 was. Personal Passion Project: Crankin the Hog
@therealelp  @Davos  No, we LEISURELY masturbate.  "Organic chemical maintenance" is how code it in our paperwork.
@familiasunshine  @davos  menudos psicópatas.
@Davos  @familiasunshine Yo ya me he estresado.
@Davos  15. Crack open a strong lager or malt liquor
@therealelp  @Davos  "Wife, I have looked in your eyes and connected with you. You're welcome."
. @Davos  they stand at the door to the basement, hesitating for forty minutes to open it. the noise stops. they move on
@familiasunshine  @DamagedGoods  @Davos  lamentablemente no es fake: https://agenda.weforum.org/2015/11/14-things-successful-people-do-before-breakfast/… Laura for president!
@muditosanchez  @familiasunshine  @davos  pues parece que la han quitado. Qué pena, me encantaba el eufemismo de "connect with their spouse".
@therealelp  @Davos  To paraphrase the great economist  Gordon Gecko, "breakfast is for wimps"
@Davos  The thy don't waste time reading stupid lists.
Igual los de  @Davos  desayunan a las 16h, qué sabremos nosotros de los horarios de una vida exitosa?
@Davos   They eat breakfast at 3:30 pm.
Hilarious bullshit.  @Davos : 14 things successful people do before breakfast
@oisin  has to be a troll lol
.  @Davos  hey 'davos' instead of promulgating a false image of class mobility, why not actually just institute a basic #income?
@Davos  guess number 9 is pre-breakfast coffee.
@Davos  They use all their energy, call in sick to work, and go back to bed.
@Davos  @chunkymark  anyone spoke to Kezia yet or is she out of branch office 
@jmclde  @FaeScotia  @Davos  @chunkymark  Apparently she will soon be 'out on a limb'

@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  100-1 it was an American gun
@BBCBreaking  @katiecouric  @BBCNews  but guns are heavily regulated in Canada.
@King_Oxly_V2 @pedrothesnake yah fuck all dem
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  sad about school shooting in Canada
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews   who did that？therefore，the gun should be allowed？eh？
@BBCBreaking  http://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/who-is-it-now-when-sirens-wail-in-la-loche-people-cant-help-but-wonder-if-its-yet-another-suicide-2… This community has been needing help for awhile now.
@stever073  @BBCBreaking   Do you live in Canada? Do you work in rural Canadian communities?
@stever073  @BBCBreaking  And do you work with rural/small town communities daily? Drugs and Alcohol are a menace in our land.
@stever073  @BBCBreaking  Wait until more guns are smuggled into our land from south of the border, then you will know how big the problem is.
@stever073  @BBCBreaking  Travelling make me know the whole world already knows Canada for that but I think we underestimate the implications.
@stever073  @BBCBreaking  Rural BC has been the most challenging place for me to work so far.
@stever073  @BBCBreaking  I presume nobody gets bullied in Ontario, and there are no bad parents in Ontario or neglect in Ontario.
@stever073  @BBCBreaking  You do need to come experience how it is in smaller communities. I think a lot of Canadians are still in denial.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  why do you keep on tweeting the same news again and again?
@BBCBreaking  @Barrybarfly  @BBCNews  pff, i laugh about every school shooting meanwhile... dont give every dork a gun! weapon law is guilty!
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  you obsessed  brits  thought the shooting happened  in America. ..sore losers
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  oh godness. Is this normal? Why they did this? I dont get it ...
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Are they torrest? Let them be brought to justice.
@BBCBreaking  Canada !!!!why ???
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  prayers
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  my prayers to this community during this confusing and shocking moment.
@BBCBreaking  What have schools been doing to people so that they want to shoot everyone in them? About time we looked at true education.

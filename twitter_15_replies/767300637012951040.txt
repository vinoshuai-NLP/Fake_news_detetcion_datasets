: "Iraq executes 36 jihadists over 2014 massacre of up to 1,700 army recruits at Camp…" #1 in #Ireland
@BBCNews  Hanging, makes the guillotine seem almost humane
@BBCWorld  @BBCNews  @CNN  @MSNBC  @ABC  @CBSNews  @NBCNews  @POTUS  /Iraq executes ISIS terrorists, Obama SETS THEM FREE! Justice?
@BBCWorld  @BBCNews  serves them right

@BBCNews  y
@BBCNews  God help the nation's of iraq
Martyrs or examples?
@BBCNews   Shia got away with it ! #Shiite #Iran
Iraq executed terrorists and war criminals unlike Saudi murdering peaceful opposition
@BBCNews  36, big deal more people die at your average Kurdish wedding than that
Unlike reporting on Govts. they don't like which are laced with bleating, innuendo & inverted  commas
we supposed to pretend that America is not the real terrorist threatening the world? That Clintons fraud isn't beckoning WWIII?
@BBCWorld  @BBCNews  #Criminal#Bastards all of them
way to go, Good Job Iraq
@BBCNews   at last someone's  got the guts to fight fire with fire,
They are ISIS war criminals / Daeshbags not jihadists
lol ISIS aren't jihadists? Please.
@BBCNews  So it's all fine when the Shia and Iranians execute people is it. Where is the classic #BBC outrage?
Hypocrisy of #BBC incredible. Some executions bad some not.Some countries relentlessly criticised, others get a pass

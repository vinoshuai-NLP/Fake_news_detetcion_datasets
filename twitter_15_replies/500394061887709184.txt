@jelani9  @kharyp  Since they want to label #MikeBrown as a shoplifter, since when is that crime punishable by DEATH?
Not sure 'shoot first & uncover potential crime later' is viable policy outside the fevered mind of a conservative  @ecl326  @jelani9  @kharyp
@jelani9  @kharyp  I bet if Michael Brown had his druthers, heâ€™d rather have his name dragged thru the mud than his life snuffed out.
damn surveillance video  @jelani9  We give up a name, we drag his thru the mud.  @LOLGOP
@jelani9  People may not like it. but it's devastating for prosecuting the cop. If true, can be argued Brown thought the cop was after him .
@jelani9  Prosecution screwed up the Martin/Zimmerman case by over-charging and if emotions guide, over charging will let this cop walk too.
@jelani9  The first goal is to get a conviction so he can never be a cop again.

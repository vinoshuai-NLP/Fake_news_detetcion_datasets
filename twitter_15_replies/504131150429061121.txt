@TheBaxterBean  @towner_terri Yeah... no. I don't trust shit from CNN. They're happy to get things wrong both ways.
@TheBaxterBean  @thedahlimmama  Skype records?
Need to  hear back from the FBI on this.  @TheBaxterBean
@TheBaxterBean  @Politics_PR  Celebrate LIFE of #mikebrown Stay in School Graduate HIGH SCHOOL  @Bows4Brains  #education
@TheBaxterBean  Absolutely wreckless, disregarded lives and safety of all other citizens, that is rage and singular focused pursuit.
@TheBaxterBean  Pretty irrefutable I'd say. This #furgeson executioner pig #DarrenWilson had every intention of #executing #MichaelBrown
@TheBaxterBean  interesting...
@TheBaxterBean  Just another way for officer to plan his testimony about shooting.  I hope grand jury takes that in consideration.
. @TheBaxterBean  @woodswalked  sure.
@hydin  @TheBaxterBean  facts have a left wing bias
@TheBaxterBean  @rconner1326  So what was this guy doing when he recorded this...no wait, I don't want to know
@TheBaxterBean  @Lynnsolsona Probably a 2nd shooter on the grassy knoll....
@TheBaxterBean  11 shots?, that's murder !

@newscomauHQ  still unverified footage
@newscomauHQ  collecting... They were taking them and showing the cameras the faces of passengers and then throwing them back down. :(
@newscomauHQ  @Harriett_Bur it's not authorities...
@newscomauHQ  Is it just mean who finds these images disturbing. To what length would you have to go to have these passports in your hands?
@newscomauHQ  How do you identify the lost souls. They are people with families, probably going on holiday or business not war!
@newscomauHQ  Strange that passports look in very good condition when rest of plane demolished.
@Roswi1423  @mirandadevine  @newscomauHQ  Yes, idiots and war criminals.
@Roswi1423  @mirandadevine  @newscomauHQ  True. It is theft, tampering with vital evidence and it is immoral and unethical.
@newscomauHQ  why are they in such good condition reminiscent of the ones found on 9/11

@sciam  @RichardDawkins  I first got involved in such projects back in 2005. 11 years later & we are still no closer to ending fossil fuels 
@sciam  @RichardDawkins  in your dreams
@sciam  @RichardDawkins  The raw fuel is free - you say it as though we're lucky it won't push prices up!
@sciam  @RichardDawkins  They look cute in the landscape! Poor birds!
@JAIMEGARCIAMOLI  @sciam  @RichardDawkins  and acid rain, fracking, oil spills and wars don't create more environmental harm?
@sciam  nothing but BS. Ask Ontario or Germany about electricity rates. Never mind the efficiency or reliability of the technology.
@kblack1970  @sciam  You only need cost of storage/wind/solar to become cheaper than oil. That is inevitable given the amount of r&d.
@sciam  I hope that this is true but I've been hearing that for the last 30 years!
@sciam  PLEASE..!!!...somebody advise governments..!!!
@sciam  I think a combo of solar and wind is the best solution for power needs.
@sciam  @RichardDawkins  I'm not convinced. Perhaps  @davidjcmackay  can have a look at the evidence :)
@sciam  @RichardDawkins  lol sure
@sciam  I'm in substations everyday, I don't see solar or wind pushing enough megawatts to power a small city let alone a country.
@sciam  Wind Energy Winning For USA!
@sciam  "if it was up to me, i would remove nuclear power from the world and..." https://youtu.be/d62-00ik3d8
@sciam  @RichardDawkins  Gee, have you been out West and seen the multitude of these already? Why not brown "trunks" with green blades?
@kblack1970  @sciam  Tesla batteries are made by Panasonic. Oil companies aren't the only ones with financial interests.
MT  @sciam  #Wind & #solar could power most of the #US by 2030 without raising electricity prices http://bit.ly/1Qq2sJP #CdnPoli #AbLeg #YYC

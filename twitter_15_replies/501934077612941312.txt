@ByronYork  @JedediahBila  If we, the people, can't hold Obama responsible for Gitmo murderer's release/actions, we're done as a republic.
@oblather  @cyndigr  @ByronYork  @JedediahBila  When is the last time in Barack Obama's life that anyone has held him accountable for anything ?
@ByronYork  @slone  The British called for the release of all their citizens and residents, no?
@ByronYork  @billpostmus  Whose to say if they joined willingly or not? No one knows. We now Bush trained the leader  of ISIS, ISIS found WMD.
@ByronYork  The beheading of Mr. Foley was so vicious.  We need to hit grouped targets, with cluster bombs, but Obama does not have the guts.
@cliffrhodes  @DocWashburn  @ByronYork  Now we see how damaging it is to have a wimp in the White House. We need boots on the ground.
@ByronYork  @corrcomm  cue the next shitstorm. It's gonna be a long two years...
@ByronYork  i bet they were sweet and innocent before they got to gitmo, too.
@ByronYork  Perhaps Obama would be more comfortable with the sanction of an imam, then US can bomb away.
@ByronYork  @bayareahausfrau  wow Frau ! Thanks for rt'
@ByronYork  @JohnG00die  Foley video I believe taken down. The disgusting slime of the earth took his life - I hope that  ISIS rot in hell
@ByronYork  @cpkinney  yeah the Brits do their job, we are playing golf
@cjosied  @oblather  @cyndigr  @ByronYork  @JedediahBila  Yeah... maybe
if they do not exist.. someone needs to be held accountable. Correct? @RangefireWifi  @ir_ScottR  @oblather  @ByronYork  @JedediahBila
@RangefireWifi WADR You saying we're all complicit is like me saying you are complicit with Trudeau. Neither true.
@RangefireWifi  @ir_ScottR  @cyndigr  Many thousands of us are demanding records. Our system is broken (cont)
Demand LOUDER. We march on DC with the intention of getting answers  @oblather  @RangefireWifi  @ir_ScottR
@RangefireWifi  @ir_ScottR  @cyndigr  USA Civics lesson; Bad people 'duly elected' are hard to remove/control.  @ByronYork  @JedediahBila
@RangefireWifi  @oblather  @cyndigr  @ByronYork  @JedediahBila  Yeah-good luck w/ that...
@RangefireWifi  @ir_ScottR  @cyndigr  @ByronYork  @JedediahBila  There's an old fashioned Socialist butt whuppin' coming for sure.
@RangefireWifi Trudeaux is hard to write plural so 'both' will have to do. ;-)
Like 2 hands clapping. Nothing doing. Nada. Zilch. Bupkis  @RangefireWifi  @ir_ScottR  @oblather  @ByronYork  @JedediahBila
We need to speak UP. Soeak OUT and make our voices HEARD @RangefireWifi  @oblather  @ir_ScottR  @ByronYork  @JedediahBila

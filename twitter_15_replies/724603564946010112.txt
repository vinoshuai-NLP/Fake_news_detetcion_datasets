@NBA  “ @BreitbartNews : Twenty-Five Stories Proving Target’s Pro-Trans Bathroom Policy Is Dangerous http://trib.al/ugBDwan”
@BreitbartNews  I identify as an eccentric billionaire.Can I have some money?
@BreitbartNews  I've been a frequent Target shopper for years. No more. Totally boycotting!! #protectourchildren
@BreitbartNews  And the Liberals STILL won't get it.
@BreitbartNews  You have some nerve supporting a man that will make this Federal law.
@BreitbartNews  What could possibly go wrong?
@BreitbartNews  this is a great example of when being politically correct is not correct. This has potential to be dangerous
@BreitbartNews  Beyond threats, what about causing discomfort to almost everyone, to prevent it for a few? What about my rights, comfort?
@labrown69  @BreitbartNews   I like how only 3 of the stories could were even tangentially related to the target policy.
@BreitbartNews  @AnnCoulter  @Morning_Joe  @seanhannity  @GovMikeHuckabee  @radiotalkermike  ..  I boycotted Target a long time ago!
Reposting it does not make it any less ridiculous.  @BreitbartNews
@BreitbartNews  @JimRobinsonSEA My only surprise is that you only have 25 stories #stop the insanity #let the 0.03% pay targets bills
@BreitbartNews  @JimRobinsonSEA Nobody with an iota of common sense needs any story 2 know multi-stall unisex public restrooms are a bad idea
@BreitbartNews  Who in their right mind is surprised by this?
@BreitbartNews  ill never step foot in a target again. I have a young daughter they want to let grown pervert men in the bathroom with alone.

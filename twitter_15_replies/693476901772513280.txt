@BBCWorld  @BBCNews  wish the UN would go & create a safe zone in Syria 4 people to live. Safer than the journey over water. Sad loss of life
@BBCWorld  @BBCNews  I suggest you stay at home then
@BBCWorld  and?
@BBCWorld  @BBCNews  parents should be charged with child endangerment ... then send them back ...
@BBCWorld  why don't people from their home country allow them to stay? Religious intolerance?
@BBCWorld  blame Merkel
@BBCWorld  @BBCNews  Very sad news again today. Someone has to step in to stop the vulnerable people being killed by traffickers.
@BBCWorld  @BBCNews  another unnecessary  tragedy while the world sits back and does nothing
@BBCWorld  another human tragedy
@BBCWorld  This will make the news!
@BBCWorld  meu deus tem misericordia deste povo
@BBCWorld  @BBCNews  remind me .. they were in Turkey. SAFE and got on a shitty boat to get to Greece. Why?
@BBCWorld  Why didn't they stay in safe Turkey, putting their children in danger.
@BBCWorld  why did they not stay Turkey, they chose to cross they knew the risks they took there own children to there deaths idiots
@BBCWorld , were there really children? I don't think so.... Just more terrorists to be added to those who already crossed the borders!

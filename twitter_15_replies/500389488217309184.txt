@LisaBloom  @southerntalker  #Ferguson Chief needs to be removed from his job...I never meant 4 this 2 happen..don't insult our intelligence
@LisaBloom  Polluting potential jurors by any Chief of LEOs should be an intentional malice reprimand,+ the county DA may be his Advisor
@LisaBloom  #MikeBrown connects the robbery w shooting. dont have to be a genius. a guy who shoves clerk is s'posed to raise his hands later?
@leonlohr  @LisaBloom  Shoving a clerk means you'll take on a police officer with a  gun? #SoundLogic #YesThisIsSarcasm #MikeBrown
@LisaBloom   stranger by the second
@LisaBloom  @Pixelfish  #IMMORTALCONSCIOUSNESS
@LisaBloom  I want to believe its total incompetence.  But its was all on purpose to change public opinion.  My guess is it will continue
@LisaBloom  that's what I thought too... http://stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/ferguson-chief-says-officer-didn-t-know-michael-brown-was/article_52c40b84-ad90-5f9a-973c-70d628d0be04.htmlâ€¦
@LisaBloom  did of release the report filed by Wilson?
@LisaBloom  he didn't say he didn't know about the robbery, it went out over radio, he said he didn't know #MikeBrown was a suspect
@LisaBloom  but mike brown knew about the robbery and DIDN'T know the cop didn't know - that's what makes it POSSIBLY relevant
@LisaBloom  @ZerlinaMaxwell  The people responsible for killing #MikeBrown should not be in control of the evidence proving what happenend.
@LisaBloom  Did the media ask for the video under FOIA as the Chief of Police said? And why was video released without  commentary in am?
@LisaBloom  Of course he did. It gave people time to solidify the opinions that they already had. It was a calculated move.
@LisaBloom  the chief said this am that cop was at a call for sick person, then got the call for store strong arm robbery

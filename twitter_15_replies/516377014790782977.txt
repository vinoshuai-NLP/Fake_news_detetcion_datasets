@sophie_kleeman    Time to re-read "Bonfire of the Vanities" again
@sophie_kleeman  also known as raise da roof there's a party in da house.
@sophie_kleeman  @Noahpinion  is there a "wol" type acronym? Wow out loud.
Going global  @sophie_kleeman : Protestors in Hong Kong mimicking "hands up, don't shoot" of Ferguson (Alex Ogle/Getty)
Surreal. MT “ @sophie_kleeman : HK rotestors mimick "hands up dont shoot" of Ferguson demonstrators (Alex Ogle/Getty) ”
@sophie_kleeman  @WesleyLowery  As 80% of this country thought nobody else was watching.
@sophie_kleeman  @rjoseph7777  still waiting for cops/army to show up in APC's and semiauto weapons. you know like in #Ferguson
@abgdinstr  @sophie_kleeman  Sadly. The Chinese military will show up in tanks, kill 100s, then continue doing business with the Free World
@sophie_kleeman  @mattyglesias  Except there's no evidence that they are using this sign as a nod to Ferguson, or even know about Ferguson.
@sophie_kleeman  Dr. King's movement of non-violence has resonated all over the world in spite of censorship of what Blacks experience.
@sophie_kleeman  The perfect example of reading unrelated events through your own contextual/ideological lenses.
@sophie_kleeman  WOW! Michael, can u see this little BRO? African Americans, Progressives & the world will not allow your death to be in vain
@sophie_kleeman  wowza

@sophie_kleeman  @revollusionist  lol ! Love it!!
@sophie_kleeman  They have no idea that Ferguson is even a place... showing their hands to show the police that they don't have any weapons
@sophie_kleeman  @tvaziri  No connection between Hong Kong protesters and Ferguson  “hands up don’t shoot"
@dgoldwas  Thanks for the correction. I’ve retweeted it.
Dear  @onekind , RTs aren't nec opinion and explain rather than blow is helpful
Dear  @onekind   As you like. Still, explain.
@sophie_kleeman  so every Cowboymovie ever was mimicking Ferguson as well? Great forsight, Hollywood.

@onekind  Thanks. My opinion: Not so much racist as view world through US filter. I 1st saw palms up in Spain demo/vigil few years ago
@sophie_kleeman  @keplyq  that simply is not so. Open hands showing no weapons has been in use for years. They don’t know about Ferguson.
@sophie_kleeman  @marcylauren  if they only knew that not only r the #Ferguson protesters a racial minority, but also an engaged minority #p2
@sophie_kleeman  @vic_bonheur In Italy we have a similar electoral law and no one protests. #Italicum #HongKongProtests  @OccupyCoscienza

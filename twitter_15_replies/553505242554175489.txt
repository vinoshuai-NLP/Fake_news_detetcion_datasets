“ @cnni : Suspects in #CharlieHebdo attack spoke to police by phone and said they wanted to die as martyrs, says MP. http://cnn.it/1xXB3Jf”
@cnni   Martyr means  we are killed due to defend our faith without killing. Otherwised...is not martyr...but devil..!
@cnni  chai....by claiming innocent lives? that's really Awkward!
@cnni  call them back and explain to them the definition of martyrs #idiots   #CharlieHebdo
@cnni  Good. Some assistance please Messieurs Les Gendarmes !
@cnni  The police r there trying to do a job under very difficult circumstances. We all realize how brave they r and thank them
@cnni  Please make sure they live a long time in cells before they die.
@cnni  they can never be
@cnni  That is what they really want, another way would be a shame for them.
@cnni    Certainly not  matyres - sorry no thousands of virgins waiting for them just fire and brimstone.

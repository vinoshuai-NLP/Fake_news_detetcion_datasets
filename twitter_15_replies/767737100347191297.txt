Sit down, Junior.

Pres Obama need no lesson on compassion so dear to his heart.
@FoxNews  @realDonaldTrump  @HillaryClinton  @POTUS
other than hold a box of play dough what did #trump do again? Oh yeah photo op.
Desperate attempts by Trump camp to make political gain out of #Louisiana flooding tragedy.
Better than ignoring it as Clinton and POTUS did
And did Papa Trump make you do this?
What's this - less than 50 seconds of "help"? https://dailymotion.com/video/x4pep9d_trump-baton-rouge-help_newsâ€¦ #photoop
The GOVERNOR of the state thought it was best that the President DID NOT come to the state!
Why is Fox News Bret Baire , lying about Trumps soft stance .Quit all the damns lies Fox .
The fake outrage seems more obvious here.
False statement. People mag already said this statement was not in their mag!
Cheep photo ops. The average non - thinking voter reacts to form over substance.
FYI for those who think I made a spelling error look at the def. of cheep!
Did #Trump actually donate anything?
I read Play Dough
What's the value to the people of Louisiana of a #PhotoOp ?
Guess you missed the LA Gov afterwards on CNN saying it was not a photo op, thanked him and said the visit was helpful.
does he work?  Where do they get time to do all these shows.
Any word on the #TaxReturns ?
#Trump never even took off his coat. #NoRealHelp
Mnwhle, your dad went against the gov's wishes, used it for a photo-op then left. That's much better.
Fake news siding with the Putin puppets
OBAMA DOESN'T CARE! The man is an embarrassment. And she will be worse.
What's the exact $ that #Trump is giving to the victims of the flood?
$100,000  of his own $.. not tax payers
have your dad send you on another big game Safari, I'm sure that will help you get over it
and where is Hillary today? Beverly Hills pandering to Hollywood libs!
Bingo! Pandering and lying are her two biggest accomplishments! (more like her only ones)
We'll said!!
What? Is he too young or too stupid to remember Dubya's response to Katrina?

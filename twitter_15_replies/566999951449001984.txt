@assholeofday  @kathydettmer  Pre-NAFTA I was single mom machinist, made perfect parts.  Had to sort Jr's scrap, he got a raise, I got fired.

@assholeofday  doesn't appear to have ever missed a meal, so Fox would consider him an expert commentator on the subject
@assholeofday  @BlueNationUntd  it's clear thAt he needs to lose a few lbs of lard between his ears #NoGOP
@assholeofday  @UdnSpeak4me  And he's a "prime" asshole.
@assholeofday  It seems decades of rejection from women may have left a bitter taste in the mouth of Sen. Thomas Corbin.  @TeaPartyCat
@assholeofday  @richardhine  Well then since men are born of women what does that say about them?
@assholeofday  @richardhine  And I'm sure some pathetic woman is married to this guy and bore him children. WHY?
@assholeofday  @richardhine  Asshole for eternity!

@whitehouse  @potus  What about the unborn Mr. President?? Does a child in the womb deserve the same protection as an immigrant on our shores?
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  Yet, the question that arises is #WhenWillThisHappen - People are #TiredOfTheWait
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  But only if you get to be born.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  good luck selling that ideal to the GOP
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  What a sad human being you are, and those that support you, celebrating murder of 54million+ babies and using "Freedom"!
@curtiswright  calm down.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  except for the unborn/unwanted
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  hypocrite
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  to dream, to rise, to share success with our brethren is a right as much as its a priveledge
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  You just love that baby killing stuff don't you
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  Except for the most innocent and vulnerable people in our country.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  did You say freedom???
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  That's because you love to hand out those entitlements for  women with 9 kids and no job to maintain them.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS   let's not forget places where dreaming big is s dream yet to be experienced
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  Yes all deserve A1 & A2 rights, to be left alone, to live life w/o a nanny, to make own choices. EPA/Flint is no joke
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  (terms & conditions may apply)
â€œ @WhiteHouse : "Every single 1 deserves rights, freedoms, & oppts 2 get our dreams". And w/out U Tryin 2 take our Constitutional rights away!
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  then stop violations of the Constitution
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  So Does That Child!
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  And thanks to people like Obama, Hillary and Sanders (in both parties) we are loosing those rights day by day.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  ah republicans, lamenting the "murder" of fetuses, but not caring about them once they're born
@WhiteHouse  @TheCananTasci  @POTUS   Roe v Wade only stated destroying fetus should be private. Abortion is Not healthcare.
@WhiteHouse  Thank you  @POTUS !! Why do all the religious nuts have to comment? If they don't agree with it then don't have one. #Icant
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS   i so love this tweet :)
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  That is of course correct but that privilege must start at our borders, its not 4 all the world.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  But they need to work for it.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS   so intruding on a woman's right to abortion is wrong, but intruding on my right to bear arms and not be insured is ok?
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  unless we're straight white males
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  thank you
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  hopes and dreams of the unborn, too?
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  Unless you're poor. Or female. Or of color. Or not of color. Or male. Or gay. Or straight. See where I'm going w this...
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS   Why is Marijuana a class #1 narcotic?
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  amen so let it be!
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  a persons a person no matter how small #MarchForLife
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  Appreciating.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  I agree 
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  Every single one of us? All of us could be killed in utero. If you want equal human rights, it starts with life. #Roe43

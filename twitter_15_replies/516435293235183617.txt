Great clarification  @jaredbkeller : No connection bw #OccupyCentral protesters & #Ferguson http://qz.com/272630/hands-up-dont-shoot-comes-to-hong-kongs-pro-democracy-protest-movement/…
@jaredbkeller  
@jaredbkeller  @bethanyhaas  certainly not a real world connection- but a spiritual one. oh? we speak the same language.
@jaredbkeller  @WesleyLowery  #no connection?  In this Tech world day&age, Ng HAD NOT heard of #Ferguson? Expect me to believe THAT!!?
@jaredbkeller  @harper  how's this anything like ferguson
@jaredbkeller  ... Other than that, Vox's story was accurate
@ThornCoyle  uh yes- but many tweeted gesture also as one of solidarity between Hong Kong and Ferguson  @jaredbkeller
@jaredbkeller  Don't think ppl thought gesture mimicked #Ferguson but instead touched by similarity in struggles. Way to get the nuance.
@jaredbkeller  @TwitchyTeam   Yeah Ferguson 'invented' it because History started that day don'tcha know.... smh /sarc
@jaredbkeller  that is a recognizable gesture for, "officer, my hands are you, no weapon, or surrender as well as don't shoot "...ijs
@jaredbkeller  @alephbass HK protesters may not be taking cues Ferguson, but they have the exact same meaning.
@linky  @jaredbkeller  for sure, and that’s important. But they are linked through spirit, not global zeitgeist.
@jaredbkeller  @GreatDismal  ...Universal gesture of supplication.
@jaredbkeller  @GreatDismal  So basically in both Ferguson and Hong Kong, protesters are waving hello.
@OCLPHK  @HKFS1958  Any truth to this?   @jaredbkeller  @KevinBankston
@OCLPHK  @HKFS1958  Any connection to hands up gesture in #HKStudentStrike with #Ferguson?  @jaredbkeller  @KevinBankston  claim no.
@Lynnier  @OCLPHK  @HKFS1958  @jaredbkeller  @KevinBankston  I want him to hear it from their own mouths instead of from a random guy on street.
@Lynnier  @OCLPHK  @HKFS1958  @jaredbkeller  @KevinBankston  That's their official twitter accounts. If you're going to get an official response
@Lynnier  @OCLPHK  @HKFS1958  @jaredbkeller  @KevinBankston  to the question on solidarity between both protest gestures, those are the people to
@jaredbkeller  @GreatDismal  seriously?  The hands up, palms out thing has been around since guns have been around.
@jaredbkeller  @GreatDismal  have none of these people seen a western?  "Come up with your hands up" is so ubiquitous it's a cliche.
@jaredbkeller  That's the advantage of ppl living in Islamic Country. They have Bloodmoney that protects civilian against govt. Tyranny
@jaredbkeller  @GreatDismal  yea, I would say that's become a pretty universal gesture now that we all live in police states.
@jaredbkeller  @GreatDismal  A correlates with B, so either A caused B, B caused A, or A and B have a common cause

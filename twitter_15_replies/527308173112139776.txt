@pierre  Bet an overabundance of resumes have been sent to u for his job   enjoying  @ggreenwald   - hope u can keep him
@pierre  @Pedinska  Sorry to see  @mtaibbi  won't be  @the_intercept . One thing is certain - Matt won't lose his voice.
@blondewbraintoo  @pierre  @JasonLeopold  agreed. I'd like to see  @pierre  's comment on that one.
@blondewbraintoo  @pierre  @JasonLeopold  @PandoDaily  this article was so unfair, hatchet job.
@andrewamonti  @blondewbraintoo  @pierre  @JasonLeopold  @PandoDaily  could you tell us why?
@pierre  but are you actually "sorry"? I mean, what are   @ggreenwald  and  @jeremyscahill  still doing there with MT gone?
@blondewbraintoo @NateEzio  @pierre  @JasonLeopold  @PandoDaily  No. If a source tells you, yes we can talk, but don't publish, that's the deal.
@andrewamonti  @blondewbraintoo @NateEzio  @pierre  @JasonLeopold  @PandoDaily  agreed and thanks. It makes sense.
@blondewbraintoo @NateEzio  @pierre  @JasonLeopold  @PandoDaily  if the writer isn't happy, that's too bad. He can go after other sources.
@blondewbraintoo @NateEzio  @pierre  @JasonLeopold  @PandoDaily  this is journalism deontology 101 and  @paulcarr  fucked up.
@blondewbraintoo @NateEzio  @pierre  @JasonLeopold  @PandoDaily  LOL seriously? I'm done. Ciao.
@blondewbraintoo @NateEzio  @pierre  @PandoDaily  exactly, WTF is going on? if it's editorial independence what are GG & JS still doing there?
@pierre  Taibbi's First Look turned into his Last Look pretty quick. I blame corporate assholes myself.
@blondewbraintoo @NateEzio  @PandoDaily  Since the source is the object, a deal is a deal. No deal no story. Journalism 101.
@blondewbraintoo @NateEzio  @PandoDaily  been reading MT since 08. Don't care where he publishes, I'll still buy. I trust authors not orgs.
@blondewbraintoo  @PandoDaily  it doesn't matter why. This is journo 101. If source is object and source says don't, you don't.
@blondewbraintoo @NateEzio  @PandoDaily
@blondewbraintoo @NateEzio  @PandoDaily  night.
@blondewbraintoo  @PandoDaily  LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
@blondewbraintoo  @PandoDaily  the last refuge of the weaker argument - excuse me sir, where's your badge?
@blondewbraintoo  @PandoDaily  yes, every single med you can imagine. And, are you a doctor, who says you can diagnose? LOOOOOOOOL ok night.
@pierre  I'll tell you what happened. The new corporate asshole screwed everything up by trying to control everything. This is PayPal II.
@pierre  Greenwald and his crew are the best. But a big splash about $250 million and blah blah blah & you have one very conventional website
@pierre  You are not a creative genius Pierre. You are flailing around. Find a genius to direct this venture.Get rid of the corpoate overlord
@pierre  this is bullshit tell us what the hell is going on over there. All u have is our trust and ur squandering it
@pierre  @acarvin  Not surprised, really. Could see that would happen. He's a star and needs a bigger stage on which to perform.
@pierre   I'm raising money for Dream Wedding. Click to Donate: http://gofund.me/fz9l7s?pc=tw_c… … … via
@pierre  @jtemplejrnalist  What happened?. Was he put off by  @firstlook 's hatred of Israel? Or something else?  A little transparency please.
@pierre  Murdoch = Bond Villain Omidyar = Monty Python character
@pierre  Are we going to find out why, or what?
@pierre  You fucked up. I doubt I'll read Racket without  @mtaibbi .
@pierre  Losing  @mtaibbi   #firstlook BIG LOSS OF TRUST in your financial reporting going forward

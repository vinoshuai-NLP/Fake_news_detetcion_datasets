@evansolomoncbc  @CBCAdrianH  So sad and terrible. I pray the soldier will be okay.  <3
@evansolomoncbc  @CBCMontreal  Once again – why can't people back off to let the injured and man helping him breathe at such critical moment?!
@WoollardRob  @evansolomoncbc  @chextv  Why is he a hero? His life is worth nothing more than the life of a civilian would be...
@evansolomoncbc  @SkanaGee  My God, I hope he will be alright and that they apprehend the bastard who has done this!

@evansolomoncbc  Hi Evan I work at  @SkyNews  in London, would we be able to speak to you on the phone about what's happening please?
@EdSmith507  @evansolomoncbc  Now is not the time for sarcastic remarks.
@evansolomoncbc  Hi Evan, could we have permission to use photo on  @SkyNews  in London please?
@evansolomoncbc  This is a very sad day For all Canadians pray for the Soldiers
@EdSmith507  @evansolomoncbc  Not today when a soldier has died protecting our war memorial.
@evansolomoncbc  @CBCHamilton  Prayers for everyone
@evansolomoncbc  press conference was a joke,zero information by 4 very uncomfortable reps. Fear still high..no calming affect by police
@evansolomoncbc  what Wld our police do if this was bigger than it is. People need answers and none forth coming. Press conference was a joke
@evansolomoncbc   Evan - is this about the list? Was this guy another one on the suspected terrorist list? What are RCMP doing with list now?
@evansolomoncbc  maybe Justin Trudeau can send us some humanitarian aid in place of Justice.
@evansolomoncbc  Ur photo of suspect's car shows tires almost flat & riding on rims.why?

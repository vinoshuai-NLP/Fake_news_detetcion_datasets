@espn  Then let the black QB shut his mouth starting this by saying...White people are afraid of me instead  saying "people" are afraid of me
@espn  u tell'em Charles
@espn  cam brought it up !! He feels he needs more exposure !
@espn  but Cam brought it up lol
@espn  : I think Cam brought it up.
@espn  I love how media are the only people that pull race cards. Then post shit like this to stir the pot
@espn  and then he goes and makes it about a black quarterback thing.
@espn  You're too late, it was about a black quarterback when Doug Williams was the QB in SB XXII...Next subject.
@espn  but in saying that he's bringing up the conversation that he's a black QB
@espn  yeaaah Charles!!! You said a mouthful!!!
@espn  cam is heavily criticized for celebrating and I highly doubt fans would write letters to the editor if Brady or Manning did that
@espn  agree with Barkley, yet Cam is the one making an issue out of it...NO ONE else did until Cam said something. Surprising? No
@espn  I never saw anyone criticize Rodgers over his celebratory champ belt hip thrust the way Cam gets criticized. Double standard in deed
@espn  it shud nvr b about race...but that's the first thing comin out of everyones mouth...what about age or experience or anything else
@espn  why even bring up the black card. Nothing was ever said about Moon or mcNabb at super bowl why start now
@espn  #impossible
@espn  I am with you on that C. Barkley
@espn  Cam is the one who made it about race the other day... You can't expect the media not to run with it because it gets attention.
@espn  if you want it to be about the "greatness of this guy" then "this guy" shouldn't bring up that he's african american on his own
@espn  agreed but media and press are driving this out of control train.
@espn  gotta love Chuck
@espn  Charles no other race will refer to Cam as Black.Because then they would be condemned as racist.
@espn  amen
@espn  Lets just not talk about blacks at all.
@espn  Never, actually thought that, till just now.
@espn  how is that. I see MVP not a color
@espn  RT, why Cam had to bring race into it is beyond me.
@Advil  @espn  no ones whining what r you saying?
@espn  NO LET'S!
@espn  happy to talk about the great year he's had. Not ready to admit he's a great QB until he does it for successive years #waitandsee
@espn  Can't agree more.  So why was Sir Charles on of the first to bring it up on Dan Patrick's radio show?  Practice what you preach CB!
@espn  Cam Newton...he could be any color in the Rainbow all I see is a awesome QB.

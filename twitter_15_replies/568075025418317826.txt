@FoxNews  GOOD GRIEF, are we this sensitive in the world today?  Give me a break.
@Steve_Shu  @FoxNews  No it actually goes to show how liberals will do anything to create inequality amongst people to drum up more support
@sharkfinfan32  @Steve_Shu  @FoxNews  correction: they create the illusion of inequality.
@Steve_Shu  @FoxNews  you can call them whatever you want Steve. Who's stopping you?

To be fair, it was in UK. KKK didn't operate there.  @FoxNews
@FoxNews  ^heck with that, pass me a jelly donut :)
@RichGetz  @FoxNews  The KKK is in the UK and if you can't identify who are the victims of the Klan then buy a book.
@FoxNews  And that's why we study history. Duh.

@cnnbrk  @onetoughnerd   Shameful that the Governor is defending his position instead of committing to do whatever it takes to make it right

@cnnbrk  @khloekardashian  @onetoughnerd  if the h20 was treated to not leach lead from pipes, Flints h20 system wouldn't be destroyed
@cnnbrk  @khloekardashian  @onetoughnerd  This is far worse than people know.  Horrific.

@cnnbrk  @onetoughnerd  did you happen to ask him whom he feels is responsible? #GOVricksynder #FlintWaterCrisis

@deray  ? Guest speaker might be more appropriate.  PhD is required for title of professor, yes?

@deray  ridiculous.
Why? What degree does she possess other than acting and taking other women's men?
RT "Hollywood Screen Goddess Angelina Jolie Will Be a Visiting Professor at the Corporation's Headquarter's Jesuit University"  @usweekly
its only temporary and visiting professors usually dont get paid.
suddenly I study in Georgetown
heard she is teaching adoption made easy, how to bang in a limo and building relationships with parents.
1. Its temporary 2. You dont need a degree 3. She will not be paid
It's no coincidence that she's starting there my first semester.  I'm pretty sure I attract fame.
@31FilmTalk Absolutely Perfect...She Is Tha Kind Of Lady All Young Girls/Kids Should Aspire Ta Be.. Amazing

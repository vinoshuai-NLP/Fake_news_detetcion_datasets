@Kotaku  Oh dear. It would be a terrible shame if Notch sold out.
@jordancollins0  @Kotaku  Sure they have, but  @MojangTeam  always prouded themself to be indie and make enough cash themselves with Minecraft
@Kotaku  everyone else saying rumored to buy but kotaku says 'trying' to buy to make it sound desperate.
@Kotaku  sweet! look at how well they managed Rare after aquiring them :-P
@Kotaku  They gotta try harder.
@jordancollins0  @Kotaku  @MojangTeam  Hm they did pretty much abandon Bukkit recently, maybe that was a sign? I REALLY hope not though
BRUH. RT  @Kotaku  Report: Microsoft trying to buy Mojang, creators of Minecraft http://bit.ly/1xFlg1l
@jordancollins0  Would that help though? Isn't MC out on Sony consoles already?(really don't know I play MC on PC only) A bit late then ^^
@Kotaku  aw hell nah
@Kotaku  @ProfWaffles  NO THIS CAN'T HAPPEN
Ick. This doesn't bode well. RT  @Kotaku  Report: Microsoft trying to buy Mojang, creators of Minecraft http://bit.ly/1xFlg1l
@xSmootx  The levels of outrage that would cause would be astronomical. Think Tombraider exclusive was bad? This would make MILLIONS pissed.
@Kotaku  #rip #minecraft
@Kotaku  Yeah, no.
@Kotaku  We saw what they did to Rareware.  Sick bastards.
@tysonfreitas  @K1NG_IC3  Don't keep up with Minecraft so I didn't. Apparently he stepped down as lead designer & thankfully not the company
@tysonfreitas  @K1NG_IC3  Knowing he's still a part of the company, makes me feel a little bit more comfortable hoping that he'll turn MS down
@Kotaku  I read that "Microsoft is raping Mojang" im so used to seing the word rape when i read a  @kotaku  article, my brain just put it there
@Kotaku  No... No, please no..!
@Kotaku  aaw hell nah

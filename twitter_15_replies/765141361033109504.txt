are you serious?
yes any chance of changing that image?
@BBCNews  wow......interesting to hear what he was up to...he was a great footballer in the day
@BBCNews  this was his last tweet back in 2014. Coincidence?
Wasn't West Mids...
it was West Mercia police, not West Mids
@BBCNews  people having a go at the police for using it but strict rules are in place, they don't just fire for the fun of it
nothing to do with west midlands police, it was in Telford.
was responding to an earlier image of a taser. Will delete tweet to avoid more confusion
@BBCNews  who he was is irrelevant, the fact tasers kill is the only story here FFS
but they do get stabbed or beaten up etc. When doin their job, they should have options to protect themselves
@BBCNews  Awful image selection....remove it as a matter of respect to the bereaved family.
correct there Steve. Bad taste BBC
@BBCBreaking   @CNA_Alerts @CNA_Media
@BBCNews  .RIP Dalian Atkinson.This Case Must Be Invesigated Thoroughly.There Should Be No Engineering. That No Lies Between Us
@BBCNews  Sad news this.
@BBCNews  police too quick to hit the tazer how do they know if the guy has a medical issue that will put him at risk.
@BBCNews  Taser guns cause electric shocks, so if a victim has a heart problem, a taser gun could result in a cardiac arrest.
nooooo. i grew up watching him at villa park
tragic hope we are not going down the US path
@BBCSport  @BBCNews  any news on why taser had to be used,was it for his own safety or safety of public/officers ??
RIP to an incredibly talented Villan. Tasers are too often lethal and unless lives are at risk shouldn't be used.
@BBCNews  I would urge you reconsider the use of word "victim" in headline highly inappropriate
- thank you for amending the headline , it's  tragic circumstances for all involved
so British  police also use force on guys who are Breathing While Black?
well a few years ago there was four officers stabbed in Harrow. The number of taser use proves nothing. Who knows what would of
happened had the officers not used the teasers?
I totally agree with that, there are good and bad in every walk of life
I disagree though, regular citizens aren't often put in hostile dangerous situations that police are
they should feel protected when doing a job
So even the threat of physical violence still doesn't warrant them?
@BBCNews  Don't know full facts yet however there seems clearly more use of the #taser ..how did we manage before ?
@BBCSport  @BBCNews  wow 
that's ridiculous, how are they put in them?
how can you compare just walkin out of your house to being sent to deal with hostile dangerous situations

@Ms_Workes  They did for real?? Seriously?
@Ms_Workes  @OpFerguson  I have been boycotting. They took what was US manufacturing and ship it out of the country. Those were OUR JOBS!
@Ms_Workes  haven't stepped foot in Walmart for almost 2 years now.  Local or small stores only, no #SaynotoCorporations
@Ms_Workes  @kiaspeaks  wow!
@AieshaArab that's even surprising for Walmart. Smh  @Ms_Workes
@Ms_Workes  Thanks for sharing, I had stopped shopping there but will have to start again now.
@Ms_Workes  did this hit the news yet?

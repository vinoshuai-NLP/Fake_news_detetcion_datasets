@realDonaldTrump  I do not think a President in the past was able to attend every memorial service. Have we forgetten the one he DID attend.
@realDonaldTrump  100%
@realDonaldTrump  King O has no time except for himself, golf and campaigning. The Court Jesters rule the land.
@realDonaldTrump  Hey Don, I'll give you a chico stick and tub of I can't believe it's not butter for your toupee. Hit me up dog!
@realDonaldTrump  Shows how much class he has
@realDonaldTrump  was Cheney there? W?
@realDonaldTrump  he was probably on vacation
@realDonaldTrump  - his actions prove how little regard he really has for our military and veterans.
@realDonaldTrump  worst president in the history of America . And that's coming from a  W Bush HATER
@realDonaldTrump  he is on vacation on the Vineyard! No time for work.
@realDonaldTrump  you are such a fucking moron
@realDonaldTrump  was Bush there? Rumsfeld? Cheney? What about the oil CEO's who's interests we are there for in the first place?
@realDonaldTrump  the real travesty is obama. He did the family a favor by keeping his worthless face out of view.
@realDonaldTrump  We as Americans that Stand Loyal with Our Troops can't expect nothing less from a "Narcissist." Obama is a very Sick Man!
@AgnesphAgnes  @realDonaldTrump  yes Obama is the sickman. not the 4xbankrupt racist laughingstock known as Trump. Get a clue.
@realDonaldTrump  did you ask to attend or is this a troll tweet?
@realDonaldTrump  did you go? You think you're the President.
@realDonaldTrump  travesty is a bit of a stretch, Generals funeral no more important than any other soldiers
@realdonaldtrump  too bad he can not interfere 4 marine in Mexico but he can on Brown's issue
@realDonaldTrump  What do you expect from him Donald? He is busy playing cover-up for al-Assad indirect support and regional failure YSE YGYT
@realDonaldTrump  He could've at least mention him in one of his many rants
@realDonaldTrump  He was too busy mourning Michael Brown.
@realDonaldTrump  He didn't know about it.   He didn't see it on the news.
@realDonaldTrump  pretty sure he's more occupied
@realDonaldTrump  Obama is just titled Commander and Chief as well as POTUS, neither makes it so. What a Disgraceto our country.
@realDonaldTrump  Golf was more important....again...
@realDonaldTrump  were you there ???
@realDonaldTrump  if you felt so strongly about it, why did you attend?
@realDonaldTrump  A travesty of what? Besides, if he HAD attended, people would just complain that he was ignoring his other duties right?
@realDonaldTrump  That's about what I would expect from a foreigner.
@realDonaldTrump  The purging of cmbt tested Com Staff almost complete, "Yes men" in place, Hussein is very close to declaring mart law.
@realDonaldTrump  Americans & Press should Stop acknowledging Obama as Pres!He'll go Insane!He's Ego will Crucify & Crush him!He'll go Mad.
Rotflmao
@realDonaldTrump   oh grow up you don't lead by good example ... there is nothing honorable in constantly finding fault w POTUS  @BarackObama
@realDonaldTrump  Sure was. This thug shows no respect to military.
@realDonaldTrump  he was busy golfing....you know that comes first for him
@realDonaldTrump  why is this different than any other soldier kiled in combat?

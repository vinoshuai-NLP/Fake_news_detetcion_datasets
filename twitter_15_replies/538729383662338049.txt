@coolhandschlute  @deray Profitable? False, or community would have more wealth:  via  @NRO
@deray  i hope yourself and the protesters keep each other safe today. #staystrong #Ferguson #BlackLivesMatter
@deray  @ABC  that was when his eyeballs were supposedly smashed in and no pics were available of actual injuries.  Smh
@deray  @ABC  all the money in the world won't stop DW from burning in hell!
@deray  @ABC  That's a ridiculous statement. Just ridiculous.
It's been profitable for  @thereval  @attorneycrump  @RevJJackson  #farrakhan for years. #tawana #dukelacrosse #trayvon #shakedowns  @deray  @ABC
@Matthops82  @sgtloser  @deray  Yes you wouldn't, think you  Faith
@sgtloser  yeah, no STRONG ARM ROBBERY vid, & no cigarillos thrown at police. We are all entitled to our own opinions, but not our own FACTS.
@sgtloser  @Matthops82 This is such a stupid thing to say that I had to come by and tell you directly how stupid it is.
@sgtloser  @_HankRearden  @Matthops82 Please go walk the streets at night in #Ferguson. Please.
@sgtloser  @Matthops82 Actually, just the opposite was found by the grand jury. Forensics back Wilson.
@Matthops82  @sgtloser  @_HankRearden  wrapping this argument around Mike Brown has weeded out any intelligent voices from their side.
@winsomebulldog  @Matthops82  @deray  @ABC  Deray doesn't care, he just wants to be famous.
@sgtloser  #classicprojection
@sgtloser  @evan_welch  Ahh, a cisgendered ignorant, racist moron.
@Matthops82  @sgtloser  @_HankRearden  it's sad Brown died, but if u attack a cop and try to take gun, u will die!
@deray  @ABC  oh, it is.look at a LOT of the wack, fake gangster rappers they push who can barely form a legitimate sentence and glorify death
@sgtloser  that's bc when cops cornered him, he complied and didn't resist
@deray  @ABC  it's amazing what greed does to people.
@Matthops82  @sistertoldjah  @deray  @ABC    And you fueled the stereo type also. Thanks to you listening to rev Al... Use your God Givin' brain
@sgtloser  @sgtj0n  How many years were you pissing on your shoes before your mom told you to aim for the water?
@deray  @ABC  Even if no money involved I bet he was paid in what questions not to ask and what facts not to pursue.
@deray  @OpFerguson  @ABC  its already aparent
@deray  @OpFerguson  @ABC  do no be disheartened friend, there are many of us standing with you against this....
@deray  @OpFerguson  @ABC  where do you come up with this shit!?
@sgtloser  @sgtj0n  Girls can't piss on their shoes? At least we've established your epic logic and deduction skills...and possibly your
@sgtloser  @sgtj0n  attraction to "Squishees".
@deray  @OpFerguson  @ABC  this whole episode, and the history that imbues it, is tragedy defined, i do what i can to change the future4better
@deray  @OpFerguson  @ABC
@sgtloser  @sgtj0n  The fictional Quick E Mart drink from the Simpsons. I'm also old enough to have greater then basic comprehension skills
@sgtloser  @sgtj0n  about a variety of issues other the cartoons. Including logic, reasoning, emotional response, recognizing facts etc.
@sgtloser  @sgtj0n  Why don't you tell me more about TMNT and justice?
@sgtloser  and another pre democrat throws in the towel because they can't back up their implanted thought process.
@deray  @ABC  his race didn't get him killed. Trying to take cops gun and attacking cop did.

*sigh* RT  @ksdknews : Confirmed: #MikeBrown had no criminal record. http://on.ksdk.com/1ovtJPT  #Ferguson
@BreeNewsome  Oh so you only care about the black people being killed?
@melvin2898  @BreeNewsome  watch out,  @MomsAgainstGam  is going to be all over you in a minute.
@BreeNewsome  Answer the question.
@ksdknews  why is his record important? He is the victim! Where is the policeman's record?!
@BreeNewsome  I doubt that. But hey you have fun being racist. :)
AND IF HE DID? RT“ @ksdknews : Confirmed: #MikeBrown had no criminal record. http://on.ksdk.com/1ovtJPT #Ferguson ”
How is this connected? How are you stupid? “ @ShavonnaMarie :  @BreeNewsome  blacks are slaughtering blacks daily. Do you care about that too?”
@BreeNewsome  Whether Mike Brown had a criminal record or not. Then you swore at the news station.
@BreeNewsome  I don't think that black people are just being killed by police. That's such a racist thing to assume.
@BreeNewsome  I think a lot of people get killed of all races. You just don't see the news on it.
@BreeNewsome  Lol because playing video games is an insult? Stick to being a racist bitch.
@melvin2898  @BreeNewsome  And to you.
“ @ksdknews : Confirmed: #MikeBrown had no criminal record. http://on.ksdk.com/1ovtJPT #Ferguson ” AND EVEN IF HE DID?!....
@XtraXtraLex  @ksdknews  don't understand why that was really looked into
That's irrelevant anyway RT  @ksdknews : Confirmed: #MikeBrown had no criminal record. http://on.ksdk.com/1ovtJPT #Ferguson
But he hopped in the car  RT  @ksdknews  Confirmed: #MikeBrown had no criminal record. http://on.ksdk.com/1ovtJPT #Ferguson

@ksdknews  @leenie909  And, you know what? It wouldn't change a goddamn thing if he did.
@Educ8tusAll  But it means it can't be used to support the cop's case in his eventual trial.

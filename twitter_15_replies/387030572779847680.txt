MT" @th3j35t3r : Non-essential shutdown? Can someone explain to me how http://fueleconomy.gov is essential while http://amberalert.gov isnt?”
@RandForAmerica  @th3j35t3r  Excellent question!
@th3j35t3r  DOJ sets guidelines for Amber alerts. Its does not issue them. Local law enforcement does. http://amberillinois.com
@th3j35t3r  There was one yesterday http://abcactionnews.com/dpp/news/state/amber-alert-issued-for-missing-2-year-old-miami-boy…
@th3j35t3r  I have the same question about Camp David staying open.
@th3j35t3r  @RBPundit  #WarOnChildren
@th3j35t3r  Obviously, a kid can't plan their escape from Perv Camp without knowing the fuel economy of the getaway car.  @RBPundit
@th3j35t3r  Seems priorities are really fucked up in DC.
@th3j35t3r  awkward moment: #000억  RT this guy...bc he's making sense  :/
@th3j35t3r  @B31tf4c3  it all comes down to when funding was awarded. If the contract to run a site is already paid, it will keep running.
@B31tf4c3  @th3j35t3r  The server that has the website is off.  DNS was re-routed to a generic "Congress is a bunch of dicks" page.
@arizonaonmymind Too true.  @th3j35t3r
@th3j35t3r  because Republicans dont give a shit about kids once they are born.
@arizonaonmymind I'll be waiting for the news.  @th3j35t3r
@th3j35t3r  @Clarketacular Not to mention why it was essential for the military academies to play their football games...
@th3j35t3r  I suppose we should simply let YOU decide what's essential and what's not? Fuck you, dude.
Because websites don’t just run on their own.  Someone has to be back behind the curtain or it just shuts off right?  @th3j35t3r  @tnicholson
@numillustration  @th3j35t3r  @tnicholson  They do have bandwidth & electricity costs. Plus many gov sites run on AWS cloud at hourly rates.

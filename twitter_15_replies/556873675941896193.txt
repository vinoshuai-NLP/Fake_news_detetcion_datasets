@SamsungMobileUS  @SamsungMobileUS  I thought the Samsung Galaxy 5 was amazing The #GalaxyNote4 looks incredibly Amazing! Photos are important
@Nightowlmama  Do you have one? #GalaxyNote4
@SamsungMobileUS
@SamsungMobileUS  yes, of the really close girl and phone also going at 30mph, but not of the far away scenery not moving with you
. @SamsungMobileUS  wouldnt recommend hanging out a car window going 30mph with no seatbelt on, holding your phone, while trying to take a pic
@SamsungMobileUS  I got one, I ain't even know it.
@SamsungMobileUS  But NOT while YOU'RE the one driving, please. 
@SamsungMobileUS  I have the #GALAXYNote4 and still have blur in my pics standing still. What am I doing wrong?

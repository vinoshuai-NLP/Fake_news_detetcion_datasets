@theScore  wait what
@theScore  Story via Tony Gallagher..  Here's a gigantic grain of salt which which to take it.
@theScore  so no team for Seattle/Quebec but give the desert a team?
@theScore  @Flyersguru  if true, I dont see what the big deal is. Every gm will be sold out. The hotels will buy tix and give them to guests!
@theScore  @Flyersguru  honestly, it cant get any worse than Arizona or Florida can it?
@theScore  @Flyersguru  the next step will be add Seattle and relocate a team to Quebec City. Then there'll be even conferences again
@latoya12  not for it or just mocking chara's mug?
But not KC?? RT  @theScore : NHL expansion to Las Vegas is reportedly 'a done deal.' http://thesco.re/XQDehK ”
“ @theScore : NHL expansion to Las Vegas is reportedly 'a done deal.' http://thesco.re/XQDehK ”  Done Deal (no owners)
@Archaeologuy  @theScore  sounds like a bit of a gamble #rimshot  @GenePrincipe
@theScore  what?? Smh
@theScore  This is a pretty bold claim.  Why Las Vegas over say Quebec Hamilton Seattle or even Kansas City. Makes zero sense to me. #NHL
Pick an easily cartoonable team name please.RT  @theScore  NHL expansion to Las Vegas is reportedly 'a done deal.' http://thesco.re/XQDehK
@earlsleek  @thescore  This is an obvious choice: The showgirls.
Wow. If Seattle AND Las Vegas get in before Quebec City...they would be pissed. Rightfully so.  @theScore  @JimTothSports
@twiterlessBilly  @kenzie_randall  @theScore  las Vegas is in Nevada but good try
Lol. $$$$$$ “ @theScore : NHL expansion to Las Vegas is reportedly 'a done deal.' http://thesco.re/XQDehK ”
@theScore  @KingLundqvist30  I hope it's solely outdoor games there.
@LLewin  @theScore  That would be sick

@adsroundtable  @theScore  NAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.  Really?
@theScore  What a Joke  @TSNBobMcKenzie  saying they could get 3 expansion teams?? Watered down product in bad markets, they need contraction
@kenzie_randall  @theScore  why not I mean LA and Arizona got a team
@autumnnreynolds  @theScore  @umkenzie  ECVUSE ME
@autumnnreynolds  @theScore  @ObiWhyKenobi  OOOOOOH MY GODDDDD

@theScore  @felixpotvin  why don't these links ever open on my phone?
“ @theScore : NHL expansion to Las Vegas is reportedly 'a done deal.'" Las Vegas Gamblers has a nice ring to it no?
@boccesauce  @theScore  Las Vegas Blue Chips or Las Vegas Sinners or Las Vegas boozers.

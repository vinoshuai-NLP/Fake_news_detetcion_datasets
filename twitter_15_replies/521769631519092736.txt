@VRWCTexan  GWB lied about nuclear weapons, the chemical weapons are the ones America sold to Saddam.
@FauxNews_  @VRWCTexan  Yeah ok! and ISIS are all good people...Go drink your Kool-aid and go back to sleep.
@FauxNews_  @VRWCTexan  You liberals are living your lives with your heads up your ass.
@FauxNews_  @VRWCTexan  You eat enough of shit your going to choke on it.
@FauxNews_  @VRWCTexan  I guess your just fine and dandy how Obozo is ruining this country.
@FauxNews_  @VRWCTexan  There's news reporters embedded in Iraq thats giving us facts. where are you?
@FauxNews_  @VRWCTexan  Kansas
@FauxNews_  @VRWCTexan  Bush kept us safe...I don't care what people say. If Bush was President there would be no more ISIS.
@FauxNews_  @VRWCTexan  He had chemicals that caused mass destruction and death to thousands of people,where do you think ISIS got them from?
@hat_trck_swayze  @VRWCTexan  @FauxNews_   I would not consider Obama an American President - Carter made many mistakes, but loves America.
@FauxNews_  @VRWCTexan  Hey Faux news,would you fight terrorists in our own country? give me a true answer.
@FauxNews_  @VRWCTexan  I guess I am correct, because the only thing you can come up with is my grammar.
@FauxNews_  @VRWCTexan  or is that you wouldn't fight terrorist in your own country.
@FauxNews_  @VRWCTexan  I apologize then.
@hat_trck_swayze  @VRWCTexan  @FauxNews_   All part of the plan.
@FauxNews_  @VRWCTexan  Can you answer my question?
@FauxNews_  @VRWCTexan  Do you understand that these terrorist want to kill Americans,Christians and Jews. We will need to destroy them sooner
@FauxNews_  @VRWCTexan  or later
@FauxNews_  @VRWCTexan  They are proud to kill and be killed...How else would you deal with these savages?  Would you rather fight them on U.S
@FauxNews_  @VRWCTexan  soil
@FauxNews_  You must really misinformed if you believe there are no terrorist in the U.S.
@FauxNews_  I know first hand and the Gov won't tell the people the truth,because it will cause a mass panic in this country.
@FauxNews_  @VRWCTexan  Are you telling me that there isn't any terrorist in Iraq?
@FauxNews_  @VRWCTexan  They are all over the world.
I suppose "Made in Iraq"  is written on them?  #libtards #UniteBlue  #TossTheBumsOut   @VRWCTexan
@FauxNews_  Yes, there are thousands of terrorist in this country maybe a lot more ready to put their mission into effect.
@FauxNews_  All I can say my friend,is prepare yourself.at least do it for your family.
@FauxNews_  There were! They are in all the middle east countries. Obama gave them a chance to regroup and form an army.
@FauxNews_  Ok I understand, there are training camps in upstate NY for Terrorist who train and fire automatic assault rifles.
@FauxNews_  The Sheriff knows and also local residents. I can't answer why the U.S. Gov don't go raid these camps.
@FauxNews_  Why else would they have and train with these weapons?
@FauxNews_  Ok! what do you suggest we do?
@FauxNews_  Islamic terrorist.
@FauxNews_  The right wing extremists will fight for this country. I don't thing they will save your ass,because you believe in this commie-
@FauxNews_  Gov and are liberal (which dosen't help)
@FauxNews_  Yes,but other countries and our closest allies will not help us because they don't trust Obama and believe he is anti-American.
@FauxNews_  I'm not going to get into it on a public forum. but don't forget what Joe Citizen said to you.
@FauxNews_  If you want to be safe in your own country,don't vote a Dem in office.
@FauxNews_  I'll ask you one more time? will you fight for your country on it's own soil?

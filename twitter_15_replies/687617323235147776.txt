@empiremagazine  @guardian  ffs! Can this not be true
@empiremagazine  Ho! Ho! Ho!...what a sad day that one of my fav villians has left us... thanks Mr Rickman for hours of entertainment #RIP
@empiremagazine  devastating
@empiremagazine  @catherineshoard  Totally and utterly devistated by this news.  #RIPAlanRickman
@empiremagazine  @robertliefeld  @catherineshoard  @rachredd
@rachredd :(
@empiremagazine  is it strange that I rooted for Hans Gruber rather than John McClane in Die Hard all because of #AlanRickman performance?

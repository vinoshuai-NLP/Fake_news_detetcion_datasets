@TwitchyTeam  can't collect taxes from a stay at home mom.
@TwitchyTeam   Trying to keep the jailers union growing
'Who is we?' Obama says being a stay-at-home mom 'not a choice we want Americans to make'?!  via  @TwitchyTeam http://bit.ly/1vqpqmV #tcot
@TwitchyTeam  I made the choice to be a stay at home mom.  Otherwise, why bother having kids??
@TwitchyTeam  am I the only one incensed by his comment? Stay away from my children cobomunist!
@TwitchyTeam  STAY AT HOME DADS ROCK
@TwitchyTeam  Mom-shaming by the president? getting desperate
@TwitchyTeam  @AJDelgado13  look carefully at the words; he would rather govt. make the choice for you. HOW DARE WE THINK FOR OURSELVES!
. @TwitchyTeam  @WhiteHouse  seriously what is wrong w/ #POTUS !!! He just successfully INSULTED every stay at home parent!!! OMG
. @TwitchyTeam  @WhiteHouse  #POTUS thinks DAYCARE better than parents?If parent chooses to stay home they are dumb?That's just dumb #facepalm
@TwitchyTeam  If this isn't a declaration of war on women, I don't know what is. They are OUR children. We built them, we raise them.
@TwitchyTeam  @maggiejaehnig  before he said stay at home moms was a job now he switching up.  Wow
Democrats hate stay at home moms, unless they are on welfare.  Remember, welfare queen is an insult.   @rsmccain  @KellyMcRebel  @TwitchyTeam
@TwitchyTeam  @OhioCoastie  he doesn't want any of us to make any choices
@TwitchyTeam  @OhioCoastie  Too bad Obama's mom didn't choose to be a stay at home mom. Too busy leaving her kid w/grandparents.
@TwitchyTeam  we know that obama doesn't know what a stay at home mom is look at his mom & his wife  not the best moms for examples 4 moms
“ @TwitchyTeam : 'Who is we?' Obama says being a stay-at-home mom 'not a choice we want Americans to make' http://bit.ly/1vqpqmV” MY choice!
@TwitchyTeam  @sdoocy what???
@TwitchyTeam  @instapundit  This man is unbelievable. I loved staying home with my kids...then went on to an even better career. #VoteGOP
@TwitchyTeam  @sdoocy and I say 45 million ppl on food stamps and counting is not a choice we want either.
“ @TwitchyTeam : 'Who is we?' Obama says being a stay-at-home mom 'not a choice we want Americans to make' http://bit.ly/1vqpqmV” #who is we
@TwitchyTeam  @sdoocy talk about a war on women. Obama is leading the charge with that statement. So much for pro choice Obama
Can't pay taxes if you're wasting your time at home with your kids. Get off your ass & be patriotic.  @TwitchyTeam  @instapundit
@TwitchyTeam  @DianeCva  I knew I didn't like that man! Sheesh.
@TwitchyTeam  @whpresscorps  Proves this man has terminal stupidity. If Michelle is not a stay at home Mom, what the hell is she?
Huh? RT  @TwitchyTeam : ‘Who is we?’ Obama says being a stay-at-home mom ‘not a choice we want Americans to make’ http://ow.ly/3tDJW7
“ @TwitchyTeam : 'Who is we?' Obama says being a stay-at-home mom 'not a choice we want Americans to make' http://bit.ly/1vqpqmV” such a tool
@TwitchyTeam  @sdoocy Talk about invasive admin - Obama typical marxist thinking. Women belong in factories working for the Regime.
@TwitchyTeam  @sdoocy Of course Michele isn't really a 'stay at home' mom. As 1st Lady she has done more than her share of traveling/campaign
@TwitchyTeam  @KarlKroshinsky  so killing your child is a "choice" they do support but not staying home to care for them. Hmmm

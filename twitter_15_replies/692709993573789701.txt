@espn  calls New England home? Doesn't he live in Cali in the offseason?
@espn  Privilege? Rirruto?
@espn  #spelling Tom Brady spelled privilege wrong in his thank u note.  Nobody noticed.
@espn  @nfl  attacks Brady for deflated balls & Broncos player who grabbed crotch in game & another who    rubbed his nuts in TB's face. Nice.
@MiracleDDLovato  @espn  Yes, U Bet. That's Why I Won't Follow This, ESPN Real CLOWN / Cry Baby. 
@espn  this is a joke but I think all those hits from Denver gave  @TomBradysEgo  a 5th graders penmanship while writing

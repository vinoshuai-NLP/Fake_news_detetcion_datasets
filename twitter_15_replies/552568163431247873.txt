@ABC  That's it, why don't you spend your time looking and prosecuting real animal abusers. Gimmie a break.
@ABC  @ABC15Desk  wow! If I had the money to bring this dog to the states I would certainly take him/her in.
@ABC  Maybe he didn´t behave and there were no swiss boarding schools there. Poor kid. He finds himself in the street tlll he learns...ha ha.
@ABC  I want to adopt him   Those owners must burn to hell!! 
@ABC  Another piece of shit dog owner...Wonder what happened, it grew and didn't stay a puppy forever? #ItGotToBig #Dumbass
@ABC  Maybe he ran away. Did you consider that? Idiots.
@ABC  @sasharuggli The abject horror of being abandoned is felt by people and DOGS, i'm hoping this fella gets a good home.

@cnnbrk  what kind of creep chops a woman with a machete? Grenada was civil i thought
@cnnbrk  How the fuck says I need a vacation, I'll go to Grenada. Pretty stupid choice.
@cnnbrk  Quite a bit of machete attacks in NY too. I get it in Grenada, but NY? Strange

@cnnbrk  KILLINGS in #BIAFRA by #TyrantBuhari, H/Fulani APC Islamic Army CNN NEVER reported! Even this School Girl!
@cnnbrk  @CNN  That's beyond sad & horrible! Husband's first instinct should have been to protect his wife. Regardless...
@cnnbrk  @CNN  If they have kids, how will he explain leaving her?!
@cnnbrk  So sad, no way for one's vacation trip to turn ……condolences to the family.
@cnnbrk  @SammGee  sigh
@Leekee  @cnnbrk  :( awful

@cnnbrk  @BeRockObams
@MisterClelland  @cnnbrk  why
@cnnbrk  Wow. Nothing says vacation, like Grenada
@cnnbrk  Who the fuck vacations in Grenada?
@cnnbrk  Any husband who runs and is uninjured while his wife is slaughtered is not a man and should live in shame for the rest of his life
@cnnbrk  It was a simple case of mistaken identity. Machete guy thought he had done the world a favour and killed Kenny G. #mistakeshappen
@cnnbrk  wow
@cnnbrk  omg was he wearing a mask? Thats like a nightmare...
@cnnbrk  he also sexual assaulted her and it was a sword, not a machete. Report facts not speculation.
@cnnbrk  when you a white American you have to realize your target in the world... Stop going to these countries.. Vacation in a USA
@cnnbrk  so he had them both and the husband got away and left her?! Something doesn't sound right. I must be missing something...

@espn  Poor OJ.  Get him an Advil.
Tell De Troof!!! RT  @espn  Doctor of "Concussion" fame willing to "bet my medical license" that O.J. Simpson has CTE:
@espn  I wouldn't call it "fame"..lol
@espn  foh.
@espn  well then, turn in that license buddy. WHAT AN IDIOT
@espn  really, who cares about a mans health who is a murderer! He should have been electrocuted several years ago. He is a disgrace to game!
@espn  and we are supposed to care that are murdering of two people has this disease, I think not
@jkm563  @espn  he didnt even technically murder anyone tho
@espn  Too freaking bad.
@espn  @LilianFlores10  
@espn  @ChrisBerman_  @DeionSanders  I said earlier, I wouldn't doubt it!  Doesn't CTE's if not caught, where those inflicted self medicate!
@espn  No wonder OJ can't find the "real killer"!!!
@espn  ... OJ is definitely affected by CTE!!!
@espn  hot take,  @ToddSolomon
@espn  Good
@espn  maybe if he confesses, what he did to his ex wife, it'll go away. From a huge #USC fan #FightOn
@espn  But when he murdered Nicole and Ron, that was several years ago, hard to believe that affected him then. #NotBuyingIt
@Teresaweaver93  @espn  he didnt murder anyone
@espn  the Doc is full of shit.
@espn  anything to get that asshole out of prison!
@espn  it was probably from head butting Nicole
@espn  #FreeOJ
@EbaLalluminati  @espn  Yes - and every other double murder in jail.
@r1122x  @espn  it actually does
@espn  what about Aaron Hernandez hahaha #shottweets #criminals
@sabina_kemp  @espn  never killed anyone
@espn  I've said it for years...
@espn  @raineerb  lol is that your doc or nah
@zxckattack  @espn  Nah that's the Will Smith doctor.
@espn  I'd be amazed if anyone was surprised by this, regardless of what they think of the man.
@JournalismJudge  @espn  lots of people do not have cte. Secondly, anyone witn severe cases do lash out violently
@espn  makes sense. Doesn't excuse him of murdering 2 ppl
@JournalismJudge  @espn  the doctor didn't say CTE caused him to kill. He is just saying he thinks he has CTE. Don't assume things...
@espn  so what, he still murdered 2 people and robbed others....
@espn  lol I hope OJ doesn't have it and this clown losses his license. Clearly no one cares enough about CTE to go watch the Concussion film
@espn  anything for another 15 minutes.  He was evil before football.
@espn  88/91 Former NFL players who's brains were studied had CTE so ya, he probably did
@espn  does*
@espn  I wonder how many former players with CTE didn't murder people

@BBCBreaking   Orphaned kids,many of them starving need to be rescued for sure, but no more economic migrants
@BBCBreaking  @TheHirstComment  @BBCNews   right approach tbh
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  majority that came to Europe are not refugees-majority are economic migrants. Take them from Syria - genuine needy.
@Foresight1st  @BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Clearly all?
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Right approach. Look at the refugee camps in Libanon, Jordan and Turkey and give asylum to the ones who really need it
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Something is better than nothing,Good to know
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  And only if they have blonde hair and blue eyes?
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Hopefully we can offer them more than a life in care and ending up on the streets.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  save the children Yes Yes Yes. Their the only innocence left in this world

@BBCBreaking  @MikkiL  very sensible , sadly many of the unaccompanied minors in Sweden are in their twenties and lying.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  because father has abandoned his children and now lives in Germany.. Sad really.  I would never leave my children.ever
@BBCBreaking  @CAllstadt  @BBCNews  So penalising those who helped themselves. Strange inversion of usual Tory dogma.

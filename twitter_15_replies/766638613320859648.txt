yay they are all leaving! Because he knows he is in the wrong
partisan media, political tools
<something about rats and ships>
@BBCNews  it's starting to look like our politics with what's happening corbyn party. But faster lol
@BBCNews  The source of the close association and Russian plot finally bursted
@BBCNews  start of trump dive
@BBCNews  see ya Paul..
@BBCNews  @USATODAY  another one bites the dust ...runs aways from comrade Trump
@BBCNews  horrifying to think of what would happen if he were elected.
@BBCNews  Let Trump too resign, so we can all get on with things.
@BBCNews  I'm still pretty certain we still have a #Cyborg #ImposterTrump in our midst. #Scifi #Horror
@BBCNews  And Krooked Klinton gives corrupt Shultz a position within her campaign? Corruptness follows corruptness!!
He obviously didn't go to Trump University as resigning shows he has brain cells.
Now if Trump would only do the same.
@BBCWorld  @BBCNews  Manafort+Russia+money=Trump campaign.  @realDonaldTrump  will play the "I had no idea" card. BUSTED!!
@BBCNews  why Quit
yes he did the right thing, George Soros, 2nd largest #hillary backer funded Ukrainian Coup, Hillary admitted to Pay for Play!
@BBCNews  the beginning of the end?
@BBCNews  he wanted to have paid leave to go get his $12m in Ukraine   but  @realDonaldTrump  said no. So he reigned instead.
@BBCNews  @realDonaldTrump  thinks this is a reality TV show #GrowUpTrump
@BBCWorld  @BBCNews  Donald should just hung hos boots money can't win him power it's lies with the people #badattidtudecantwin
Good for U, later U would be fired anyway by #Trump, POTUS or not
BBC media were all liars,we have known their tricks   @bbcbreaking
" @BBCBreaking : Donald Trump's campaign chairman Paul Manafort resigns http://bbc.in/2biJGYw"
@BBCNews  firing one is unfortunate but to fire two seems sheer carelessness. Once in office he will change the 4x terms to life
@AmiYamato  @BBCNews  he was most likely fired, this is just the cover story
Quite possible. But either way, it means Trump is planning something even more barmy than usual!
@BBCNews  Trump administration would be very disastrous.
@BBCNews  With the court case and failure to submit tax returns I think it's over for bush the 3rd.
I guess Putin pulled the plug on this operation?
: "Donald Trump's campaign chairman Paul Manafort resigns http://bbc.in/2biJGYw" #1 in #Ireland http://toprt.com/TopRT_IE/?t=766638613320859648â€¦
@BBCNews  Common sense prevail at last. Very smart move.
@BBCNews  #Bannon Makes #PaulManafort Look Like A Saint!!! #Trump Sinking Fast!!!
@BBCNews  Paul Manafort was fired. And it is good

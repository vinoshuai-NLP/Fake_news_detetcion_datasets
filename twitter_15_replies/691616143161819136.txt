@parisreview  @Stirlingwriter  blimey, what a wind-bag
@parisreview  @fonolog  Was born today in 1882???? Vreemd.
@parisreview  @MissEllieMae  just cause for celebration to the lighthouse still one of the best books I have read about love and loss
@parisreview  loved listening to #words of #VirginiaWoolf
@parisreview  Neat! Am I the only one who thinks she sounds a bit like Julia Child?
@parisreview  Consonants like seperate entities. Rounded sounds like polished pearls, over refined by years of privilege. So verrrrry posh.
@parisreview  this recording sounds as though Ms Woolf was under Water.

@smartie999  "Perhaps then 1 rsn why we have no great poet, novelist or critic writing to-day is that we refuse words their liberty."
@smartie999  isn't it so lovely? Hope you are well? We are really well, enjoying a mild winter in Toronto. And you? x
@parisreview  @StephanEnter  Ohh damn, I missed that. She was one interesting source of renewal in literature...

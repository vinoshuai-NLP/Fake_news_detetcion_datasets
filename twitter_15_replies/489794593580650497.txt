@HuffPostUK  that's a bit sensationalist there's no reports of it being shot down only that it's crashed
@HuffPostUK  wtf
@HuffPostUK  Malaysia Airlines should just give up now
@huffpostuk  @trevjsmith do you have confirmation?
@atclew  @HuffPostUK  watching ABC news and they are talking a about a missile but they don't know for sure
@atccpv @trevjsmith  @huffpostuk  just might be.
@ATCCPV @atclew  @HuffPostUK  crazy stuff

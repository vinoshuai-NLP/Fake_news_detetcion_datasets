@TMZ  Oh here we go. I should just unfollow you TMZ but I'm hoping that you may actually write something newsworthy in the future.
@TMZ  let him do society a favor. And save some tax payers some money  #sick #prisonorange #genpop #inmateshatechomo
@TMZ  All about getting ppl to click on web stories to read more, but this tweet was just misleading.
@TMZ  REALLY?!?!?!!  You know damn well this was not true...Cops came because a news crew heard noises near his home..get your facts straight
@TMZ  WHY are people so "surprised" when a "celebrity" does appalling things?! They're Humans just like us & aren't immune! #BackgroundCheck
@_kdev  How the hell did you come to that conclusion from my slamming TMZ for false reporting...You are the one who needs help & an education

@Real702Heat  @TMZ  False alarm.  Wasn't him.
@TMZ    ..if his wife knew long ago and didn't report it -she put additional kids at risk - she put money in front of kids....
@TMZ  Good God....people simply amaze me these days!

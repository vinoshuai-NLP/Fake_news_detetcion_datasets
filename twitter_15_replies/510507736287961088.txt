@NickKristof  @acarvin  de facto terrorism funding.  Not an easy choice
@NickKristof  @acarvin  ay. SO wrong. And that's all I can currently express. just, well, ay.
@1murman1  @NickKristof  @acarvin  Try reading more carefully: Foley's family wanted to pay ransom & government said no. Your taxes were safe.
The tragedy: Cash was the making of #ISIS and ransoms made journalists "walking ATMs"  @Independent  5/14  @NickKristof  @acarvin  @rhondaABC
@nickkristof  @acarvin  Amazing, and unbelievable.
“ @NickKristof : US govt reportedly threatened to prosecute family of Jim Foley if it paid ransom http://abcnews.go.com/International/government-threatened-foley-family-ransom-payments-mother-slain/story?id=25453963#.VBNGHXsunYU.twitter… h/t  @acarvin ”
@Revenant0202  @NickKristof  @acarvin  Just more of the most transparently corrupt administration ever. And that's a high bar to clear!
@NickKristof  @Revenant0202  @acarvin  Paying ransom to terrorists is, for good reason, illegal.
@NickKristof  NOTHING that this administration does surprises me anymore. I am disgusted but not surprised  @acarvin
@NickKristof  @acarvin  Obama paid 6million to ransom the traitor/deserter  jihadist dirtbag Bergdahl
@NickKristof  @Letters4America  pray for those family members who lost their son,brother,uncle.our biggest threat seems 2 B our POTUS.
@NickKristof  @Letters4America  @acarvin  U.S. government is blind to Foley's family. They even deny the existence of homeless in America.
@NickKristof  @acarvin  OMG
@NickKristof  @acarvin   While I feel 4 the Foley family,like any ransom paid, that will courage more kidnapping 4 ransom money. He knew risk

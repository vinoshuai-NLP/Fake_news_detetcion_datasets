Congrats@ #USA GOLD #Rio2016
only twenty-four years other countries realize basketball isn't necessarily sport of champions, however  @wheaties  remains to be so
USA #Gold
what was the final score couldn't watch the rest of the gm after the half
Now this was the best of all the USA Dream Teams. Best of the best on this team.
looks like global bball is going backwards. Blowing out Serb is not a good thing. Makes Olympic bball a non event #bigpicture
dream team beats this cast of crumbs by 30
that team was a dream. Man
wow. Great Ballers
That 92 #DreamTeam would beat this one by 30 plus points.
ppl need to wake the fuck up DREAM TEAM couldn't be fucked with even if LEBRON was playing. This generation don't know basketball
Basketball for this young generations is who got the best shoes coming out.
So can these sorry ass sports writers who probably never played sports in their life stop comparing this team to the DREAM TEAM
man Deandre Jordan couldn't stick Ewing nor Hakeem, plus their guard play couldn't fuck w/ Jordan Magic or Bird
Good thing they won or Durant would've left for Serbia
real original
It's purely an American game.

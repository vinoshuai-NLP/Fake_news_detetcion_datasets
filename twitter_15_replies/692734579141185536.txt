@Gizmodo  why did they pushed an update recently...???
@TomusK  @Gizmodo  #ISpy 
@Gizmodo  I hope it gets no rest. I hope the devil pokes it every hour to prompt it for an update. It'd be suiting.
Browser plugin that is... “ @Gizmodo : Oracle is finally killing, Java. Rest in hell, Java. http://gizmo.do/EI1X4Wv ”
@Gizmodo : What would happen to most Indian #Bankers who used to authenticate #biometrics in the Browsers (especially IE) using #Java Plugin?
@Gizmodo  thought it was just the java plugin? Very misleading clickbait?
@Gizmodo  It's not Java that they are killing, tho...
@Gizmodo  uh oh, @slothborn doesn't the USPO have a java filing system?
@Gizmodo  this is called click baiting.. They are retiring java browser plugin
@Gizmodo  I wish the people at Gizmodo would stop being morons and see the difference between the Java Language and the Java Browser Plugin.
@Gizmodo  and in a while even the bitter aftertaste will be gone.
@Gizmodo  errrm no they are not. Get it right
@Gizmodo  they're only killing Java plugin for browsers, not Java. Awful tweet...
@Gizmodo  @pbdbruno Gizmodo só fala bosta O que vai morrer é o JWP Java tá forte ainda
@Gizmodo  They're just killig the java plugin, not Java
@Gizmodo  1) no they're not, 2) this is a terrible article
@slothborn  @Gizmodo  that's good to hear
Oracle is finally killing, Java plugin. Rest in hell http://gizmo.do/EI1X4Wv  via  @Gizmodo
@Gizmodo  >java is bad meme Oh, Gizmodo, you're not supposed to actually reveal how inept you are! Just hint at it so we can tease you.

@WhiteHouse  Love this - except it's painful how badly the cameras don't match, and how distorted the aspect ratio is. (Are interns filming?)

I love those things he does to remind himself of people and why he's there.  @WhiteHouse  @metaquest  @POTUS
@Mwforhr  @WhiteHouse  @POTUS  I love that he cherishes the astonishing connection he has with people all over the world.

@SportsBizNews  @JenkinsSports  I think two current teams would move in that situation.
@SportsBizNews  @bcondotta  Seattle has one Stanley Cup already. Woot! Lets get another.
@SportsBizNews  No chance for Portland to sneak in?
@SportsBizNews  Let's be honest. They're only expanding by 4 so Tortorella will have a job somewhere.
Don't tease " @SportsBizNews : NHL expansion – four teams added by 2017, Quebec City, Toronto, Seattle, and Las Vegas $1.4b in expansion fees”
@SportsBizNews  @MarkLazerus  I'm sure that all of Toronto will be emotionally vested in the Non-Leafs.
WHAT?? “ @SportsBizNews : NHL expansion – four teams added by 2017, Quebec City, Toronto, Seattle, and Las Vegas $1.4b in expansion fees”
OMFG RT  @SportsBizNews  NHL expansion – four teams added by 2017, Quebec City, Toronto, Seattle, and Las Vegas $1.4b in expansion fees
Didn't Vegas ECHL team just fold? RT  @SportsBizNews : NHL expansion 4 teams added by 17, QC, Toronto, Seattle & Vegas $1.4b in expansion fees
@SportsBizNews  @MarkLazerus  is this legit happening or just proposed?
“ @SportsBizNews : NHL expansion – four teams added by 2017, Quebec City, Toronto, Seattle, and Las Vegas $1.4b in expansion fees” !!!!!!!!!!
RT  @SportsBizNews : NHL expansion – four teams added by 2017, Quebec City, Toronto, Seattle, and Las Vegas $1.4b in expansion fees
@sonicsman  I thought Toronto has a team
“ @SportsBizNews : NHL expansion – four teams added by 2017, Quebec City, Toronto, Seattle, and Las Vegas $1.4b in expansion fees”  @skot_30
@sporrer17  YES!!! They need a facility though!
“ @SportsBizNews : NHL expansion – four teams added by 2017, Quebec City, Toronto, Seattle, and Las Vegas $1.4b in expansion fees” source?
@SportsBizNews   CLE (again). With Dan Gilbert as owner.
@SportsBizNews  nice opinion.  But you're guessing.
“ @SportsBizNews : NHL expansion – four teams added by 2017, Quebec City, Toronto, Seattle, and Las Vegas $1.4b in expansion fees” Agreed.
@SportsBizNews  @NHLtoSeattle  Atlanta did have to franchises 2x (Atlanta Flames & Atlanta Thrashers) NO MORE TEAMS IN ATLANTA
“ @SportsBizNews : NHL expansion – four teams added by 2017, Quebec City, Toronto, Seattle, Las Vegas $1.4b expansion fees”  @TheMikeSalk  huh?
More importantly, 4 more organists! RT  @SportsBizNews : NHL expansion – 4 teams added by 2017, Quebec City, Toronto, Seattle, and Las Vegas
@organistalert  @SportsBizNews  what plays in Vegas stays in Vegas.
@SportsBizNews  @Smyth94ever  I can guarantee that another team in the Toronto area wouldn't work. No one cheers for it over the Leafs.
@SportsBizNews  @Smyth94ever  also, if that were to happen, day bye bye to the Sabres.
@SportsBizNews  to me, stupidity. Nhl in Vegas won't work.
Hmm. Really? RT  @SportsBizNews : NHL expansion – 4 teams added by 2017, Quebec City, Toronto, Seattle, and Las Vegas $1.4b in expansion fees
@Softykjr  34 teams sounds like a bridge the NHL wouldn't want to cross. I could see these places having teams, but not all via expansion.
@SportsBizNews  @AMAAS  I think Quebec and "Toronto" (Ontario) get expansion teams. Seattle a maybe. Vegas gets a relocated team.
@AMAAS  I agree, Vegas a long shot. Leagues want to avoid Vegas for obvious reasons, no matter how lucrative it seems.
@tonybalogna  Vegas does NOT have enough of a permanent fan base to support a major professional team in any sport
@AMAAS  Seattle is very close to Vancouver, and there has been little movement in building a new arena, which NHL will insist on.
Woahh “ @SportsBizNews : NHL expansion – four teams added by 2017, Quebec City, Toronto, Seattle, and Las Vegas $1.4b in expansion fees”
RT  @SportsBizNews : NHL expansion – four teams added by 2017, Quebec City, Toronto, Seattle, and Las Vegas $1.4b in expansion fees
@AMAAS  Bettman said himself a few weeks ago that Seattle not being considered right now. If they build an arena? Sure. But not before that.

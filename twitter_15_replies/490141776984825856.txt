RIGHT! Accusations fly as investigators seek answers over #MH17 crash in #Ukraine http://cnn.com/2014/07/18/world/europe/ukraine-malaysia-airlines-crash/index.html?sr=sharebar_twitter…  @CNN  @CNNEE
@CNN  some pretty fast analysis, I'm sure they would never lie to the American people. Totally trustworthy with a great track record.
@CNN   #RIP to those people who died in the plane crash !!!!
@cnn  all #debris in one place? But how can all matter did flight at one direction? flight mh17 vs. #mh370 not found and hadn't been shoot?
@CNN  #GazaUnderAttack ! #stop !
@CNN
@CNN  stop lying... you are USA"s agent.
@kimkardashi_ann  @CNN   hi
@CNN  Highly unlikely,they can't afford that kind of weaponry nor do they have the technical expertise to use it,this is Russia's doing.
@cnn  Обама черт...весь мир уже достал...американцы меняйте президента
@CNN  Not to be gruesome but...where are the bodies (body parts)? A plane is blow up and there is not even a finger around? Hmmmm
@CNN  HAVE MERCY
@CNN  @DubsterCali  Not only do we know who fired the missle we probably listened to the whole thing unfold.
@swatson1865  @CNN  Its a new potential scandal that CNN will hide from America as usual!
@CNN  Um..we knew that already. Even Ukrainians don't fire at that altitude(!)
@CNN  Have investigations as rebels did not confirm missiles was fired by them neither Russian forces yet took responsibility. #MH17
@CNN  But one thing is quite similar to #MH370 is equal to #MH17. It could be vulnerability of 777 boing especially belong to Malaysia
@CNN  Should worry about the US problems instead of other countries. They obviously found out by spying on pro-Russians
@CNN  How sad!
@CNN  And Russia doesn't just loan or give away multimillion dollar missile launchers,even to allies,they're not that dumb.
@CNN  @Rachel__Nichols  anything on fixing the problems in Chicago #chiraq..?
@CNN  well I hope so
@CNN  why haven't you said a single word about the appr.190 dutch victims?
@CNN  airplane didn't explode in the air. If it was shot down it would have exploded in the air not on the ground
@CNN  plane didn't explode until it hit the ground.....not believing news reports. Same scenario as previous Malaysian tragedy.
@CNN  how sure?your information about this #MH17 is not stable,where is your proof?
@CNN  US INTEL=SUPPOSITION=MOST LIKELY.........
@CNN
@CNN  lies
@cnn  If a lie is repeated multiple times, for a stupid person becomes the truth, but...
@cnn  ... for clever man lie remains a lie! Это для вас CNN!
@CNN  @DAVIDMDRAIMAN  The only sure thing is that there are 298 people died! R.I.P. https://youtube.com/watch?v=28MrASx-RiM&feature=share…

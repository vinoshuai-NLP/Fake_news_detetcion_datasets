@cbcJillDempsey  @CBCNews  very sad news.
@cbcJillDempsey  @mmdenisrc  Well, he's not. Kenney screwed up.
“ @cbcJillDempsey : Conservative caucas informed soldier shot at War Memorial in Ottawa has died.  A sad development on a shocking day.”
@cbcJillDempsey  @CBCNews    did the DND tell you this?
@cbcJillDempsey  @CBCNews   so sad :(
@cbcJillDempsey  @mmdenisrc  MP Kenney withdrew his tweet...confusion around...
@Mabergeron1974  @cbcJillDempsey  @mmdenisrc  info is sadly true
@cbcJillDempsey  @CBCNews  It's NOT up to MP's to release any info on anyone shot, let alone a Canadian Soldier. Think of the family!
@cbcJillDempsey  @CBCNews  has this been confirmed? Apparently Mr Kenny may be combining the 2 incidents from today and the other day in Qc
@VibezMediaIntl  @cbcJillDempsey  @CBCNews  no info is sadly true
@cbcJillDempsey  @dangles70  RIP
@cbcJillDempsey  @CBCNews  Such sad news - thoughts and prayers to his family, friends, and military family. #dnd #military #hamilton

@juliamacfarlane  @dangillmor  classic misdirection. Probably seals or MI6.
@juliamacfarlane  As they say, smartest criminals make mistakes too!
@juliamacfarlane  Pakistan, West Bank, Iran. So they left id to make them know that they are Muslims of France. But not any of above 2/2
@juliamacfarlane  its a bit like the 9/11 reports of finding the passports of hijacker!
@juliamacfarlane  @dandrezner  Highly trained doesn't necessarily mean always smart.
@juliamacfarlane  @petedavo_world  Maybe the gunmen were better trained than the getaway driver? #weakestlink
@milnews_ca  @juliamacfarlane  The answer will probably start with "S". Stupid, or Staged and depends on Smart. ;)
@juliamacfarlane  @_EmmaGH  smells of rotten eggs placed on purpose ... !
@juliamacfarlane  @ejs921  There is a minute possibilty that unpopular leaders #FalseFlag these operations (9/11) to gain immediate favor.
@juliamacfarlane  and they got the wrong building at first
@juliamacfarlane  So they are either amateurs or it's a false track...
@juliamacfarlane  don't ask too many questions someone might accuse you of being a journalist
@juliamacfarlane  Perhaps they were in a hurry for some reason.
@juliamacfarlane  how about the story that friends of the third suspect Hamyd saw him in class 230km away during the attack
@juliamacfarlane  Some are thinking they are stolen ID cards & were left to confuse the police.
@juliamacfarlane  They want to known.
Adrenaline  @juliamacfarlane  @JesseDrucker
@juliamacfarlane  @Bkjowasserman  a ruse to divert security forces/
@juliamacfarlane  @Partisangirl  part of the fake out if they are mossad?
@juliamacfarlane  THANK YOU!
@juliamacfarlane  @Partisangirl  they're trained in a military sense. And I'm sure we can all agree that the military isn't perfect
@juliamacfarlane  @Partisangirl  Because they forgot to fax it to the police beforehand
@juliamacfarlane  @Partisangirl    Confused?  Like the intact documents found in street after 911?
@juliamacfarlane  @Partisangirl  Perhaps they are not as professional as everyone assumed.
@amuse  @juliamacfarlane  @dangillmor  These men were clearly military trained...
@juliamacfarlane  @Partisangirl  original WTC bombers went back for their rental deposit not the sharpest tools in the shed usually ! :)
@juliamacfarlane  @PeterPyke  ;Who says they were highly trained?They will be dead shortly.Let's wait for the dust to settle,then we will see!
@juliamacfarlane  @Partisangirl  Perhaps on purpose - for "Glory & Honor" - as much as possible
@juliamacfarlane  The media also keeps up the insinuation of Russian automatic weapons.
@juliamacfarlane  @2ndNewMoon  jihadists use to leave their id passport before suicide actions and deliver their identity through video
@aldotorchiaro  @juliamacfarlane   they are scary persons
@juliamacfarlane  @Partisangirl  Like Sydney siege it wasn't necessary, perhaps? Entrapment? Sod those killed, "Security" can now B beefed-up?
@juliamacfarlane  @Techpaste  I said exactly the same to my friends yesterday, just seems strange
@juliamacfarlane  @rico_hands  #falseflag that was the plan  to leave ID behind.
@amuse  @juliamacfarlane  @dangillmor  exactly. Something which isn't achieved through a day at the shooting range...
@juliamacfarlane  @AlanaBowker  I suppose they don't care! Their mission is to kill not get away. They like to be martyrs! #JeSuisCharlie

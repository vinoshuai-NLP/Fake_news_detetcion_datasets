@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  All traitors should be stripped of citizenship .
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Terrorists who choose to blow up innocent people shouldn't have the right to stay in France. They showed no compassion
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews   If you make war on the people that educated and embraced you into their culture with democracy and freedom .
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  then Wat country will they represent or wil they b prisoners without a country..terror convicts prisoners
@bloggi  @BBCBreaking  LOLOLOLOLOL
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  my first instinct was to agree, but then where is the line? Any form of unrest could be classed as terrorism.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  great idea UK should do the same, could also charter a plane for anyone wanting to head to Syria & drop them all off.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Good, let her quit, no one has the right to rob innocent people of their life
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  I always thought an attack on your own country was treason ?
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Death sentence will be useful but the French have already removed this option.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  you do realise this is the path to 1930's Nazi Germany !!, she is a politician with principles - priceless
@bbcbreaking  WHAT DOES SHE WANT TO DO GIVE THEM A MEDAL  FOR THEIR ACTIONS
@BBCBreaking  @BBCWorld  Doesn't sound like a bad idea if they mean ppl who aren't born and bred natives (french in this case).
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  stupid frenchies.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  strip her off citizenship
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews   Good riddance!
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  excellent idea. To many of them get away with it.were to soft in this country. 
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews   You can see where her sympathies lie . French bete noir.
I agree 100% with the French government's plan to strip terrorists of their citizenship!  @BBCBreaking  @BBCWorld  Why is this controversial???
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews   Good move for the French people who love france.If they don't love france theycan all go back to were they came from
@BBCBreaking  Could make case if have come to France/had dual citizenship, but wrong to remove it if born there (violates international law?)
@BBCBreaking  What! A terrorist does not recognise abide by or accept the laws of the land they rain terror on. They have removed themselves
@BBCBreaking : "French justice minister quits in apparent protest at plan to strip citizenship…" #1 in United Kingdom http://toprt.com/TopRT_GB/?t=692267960686284800…
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  good idea ! Wonder if the British goverment would have the balls to do that ? I think not !!
@BBCBreaking  @BBCWorld  @BBCNews  Why would the nation of liberte egalite fraternite want to take such a retrogressive step??
@BBCBreaking  @BBCWorld  @BBCNews  an that should be so send them back from whence they came for her protest let her become a citizen of Syria!
@BBCBreaking  @BBCWorld  @BBCNews   AND SHE SHOULD LEAVE SHE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THE FRENCH PEOPLE AND THAT WAS HER PRIMARY JOB TO CARE 4 THEM
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Good riddance!
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  If found guilty of terrorism they should be stripped of their citizenship
@BBCBreaking  terrorist have human rights not the innocent victims, politically correct policy
. @BBCBreaking  1/2 It is worrying that we would rather remove our own civili liberties rather than
. @BBCBreaking  2/2 simply acknowledging that those who have joined ISIL have, in the process, given up their citizenship.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews   Idiotic commenters here don't read the article - it only applies to dual citizenship - it's an extremely tame change.

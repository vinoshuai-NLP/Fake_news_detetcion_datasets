@espn  how come this is the first year we are hearing  @StephenCurry30  is a  @Panthers  fan???
@HeadCase15  he has always been a Panthers fan he's from North Carolina
@espn  this is the worst thing I've ever read. Slow news day or?
@espn   STEPHEN CURRY. EL NIÃ‘O DE ORO. DLB
@espn  They both settle for 3's in the big game?

@espn
@espn   they're both WAY over paid ?
@espn  yeah that's Riteeeeee  & theyyyy Both Good  #warriornation #keeppounding
@espn  lots of good facts and research, I wonder how currys dance moves hold up against newtons. Got a feeling Newton is going to go hard #ya
@bigdongbrad  @espn  They both have a lot to be dancing about! #TeamUA
@espn  Curry has way more class than Newton.
@espn  scam from GA tho.
@espn  so the only thing they have in common is still North Carolina
@espn  every1 defending curry bout where he grew up but he never "repped" #Panthers til now? That my friends is the definition of bandwagoner

 RT  @BuzzFeedUK : This letter to parents from a 1970s Lego set is years ahead of its time http://buzzfeed.com/jobarrow/its-the-imagination-that-counts?bftw=uk…
@BuzzFeedUK  @sisterspooky  But now it's all about tie-ins to movies where one can only build one thing, as  @badbadpoet  pointed out to me.
@BuzzFeedUK  Not really! There were lots of progressive people around in the seventies. Honestly. Pretty much same as now.
@BuzzFeedUK  @OwensDamien  Either Lego were a bunch of amateurs in the 70s of this is a fake.  My money's on fake.
Nice RT  @BuzzFeedUK : This letter to parents from a 1970s Lego set is ahead of its time http://buzzfeed.com/jobarrow/its-the-imagination-that-counts?bftw=uk…
@BuzzFeedUK  I think this may be a hoax. The letter is printed in "Germany" and not in "FRG" or "West Germany" as it was usual in the 70's.
@BuzzFeedUK  @malorieblackman  To my mind we are now at least fifty years behind our times and understanding. It's no accident.
@BuzzFeedUK  that looks so fake.

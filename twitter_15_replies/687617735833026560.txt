@empiremagazine  Let's not forget, for a glorious few moments he was also Bill Clay.
@empiremagazine  he is the metatron, herald of the almighty and voice of the one true God.
@empiremagazine  He was HANS GRUBER ! Know you've said that already but for goodness sake, this is heartbreaking.
@empiremagazine  he was Metatron #dogma 
@empiremagazine  Eamon de Valera to Neeson's Michael Collins. The best at being bad
@empiremagazine  it was his Judge Turpin that made me fall in love with him. What a voice, what a man. True legend. #sweeneytodd #prettywomen
@empiremagazine  @DarthMarenghi  don't forget Colonel Brandon. He stole Kate Winslet's heart and mine.
@empiremagazine  @alliebits  He was the voice of God, Metatron #dogmamovie
@empiremagazine  @Evil_Keyla He was and is One of a Kind! A spark that lit up the screen and gave us countless Hours of memories 2 treasure!
@empiremagazine  he was an ACTOR, with capital letters. RIP Alan Rickman
@empiremagazine  Metatron, too.

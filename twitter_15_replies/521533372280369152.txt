@TMZ  how many times you gonna post this shit?
@TMZ  I wonder how many of his victims have wanted or have attempted or had suicidal ideations regarding what happened to them
@TMZ  wow, this saga will not end well regardless.
@TMZ  Why on earth are you retweeting your old mistaken stories? Dumb.
@TMZ  He wasn't on suicide watch after the first incident? I guess People wanted him to kill himself.
@TMZ  TMZ wrong for this repeat story.
@TMZ  why repost this when it happened 5 days ago?
@TMZ  Again? Slow news?
@TMZ  this is a week old!!! I'm tired if repeats!
@TMZ  Why are they posting this from 9/7? geesh... Imo, very old news, based on media terms...
@TMZ  This family is going through a tough time. I think media should step back while they iron things out.

@BBCBreaking  ??pretty sure Greece isn't blowing kids up, starving them or other war crimes in middle east Cause&Effect
@BBCBreaking  the European Commission neglected obligations to predict such a migrant event could happen and prepare for it beforehand
@kottwitz  @peter_kimber  @BBCBreaking  ψοφα φασιστα
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews
@BBCBreaking   Greece shouldn't be penalised due to its proximity to Turkey. There is no way they could patrol the whole coast.
@dsaliagopoulos  @BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  turkeys been doing their part by shooting Kurds and Syrian refugees I'm sure Europe loves them
@BBCBreaking  @BBCWorld  @BBCNews  that commission sure does love to condemn countries to take the focus off its own failures
@BBCBreaking  Well it's obvious why couldn't I see that it's all the Greeks fault
@BBCBreaking  @BBCWorld  Greece has seriously neglected  (insert whatever you want here).....
@BBCBreaking  I smell a "Scapegoat". 
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews   Shock ...
@BBCBreaking  @BBCWorld  so EU is suggesting the uncontrolled mess over migration is the fault of the Greeks
@BBCBreaking  Excellent work. Can you please tell me the colour of the sky above you tomorrow?
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  what were they supposed to do? Shoot the boats out of the water?
@glowspider  @BBCBreaking   http://euractiv.com/sections/global-europe/commission-schengen-suspension-could-be-extended-60-migrants-should-be-sent…
@marksthename1  @BBCBreaking  They should have offered Greece money to bolster their navy and enforced a return policy for economic migrants
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  What has Turkey done with £3billion given by EU? They've done nothing to stop the boats or arrest the smugglers.
@BBCBreaking  EC has generated a report! Light at the end of the tunnel ...
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews    Greece did neglect its borders, but it had little help or guidance from the EU considering the state of its economy.
@BBCBreaking  Considering that Greece is broke, and the immigrants are simply transiting thro, then it isn't surprising. No report needed.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  it costs money. They haven't got any. Because Merkel wanted payback. Ironic. She's now got migrant trouble at home
@BBCBreaking  Meaning Greece only EU country not to erect fences,baton charge,teargas,steal item,abuse,denigrate refugees fleeing persecution
@BBCBreaking  @BBCWorld  @BBCNews  it's easy to say so if your borders are not in water.What,should we build up fences on the Aegean Sea?
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  to go with their economy lol
@BBCBreaking  What a ridiculous statement to be said. The EU is clearly falling apart.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  with what money? Extra resources required to control the border with balancing books already an uphill struggle
@BBCBreaking  GREECE NOT ALONE,  Germany, France, Belgium, Sweden & UK all overtaken by "migrants". All will transition their cultures.
@BBCBreaking  So, should we start shooting and drowning people in the sea? No? Is there another way? Why not stopping them in Turkey instead?
@BBCBreaking  @GreekAnalyst  @BBCNews  ask Turkey to close their borders. Now there is a solution. Maybe, stop the wars? Hmmmmm!
@BBCBreaking  no no no eu has let Greece down they can't afford it set up for failure
@ti_zoume  ο μαλάκας ο Καμμένος το έμαθε;
@BBCBreaking  The navies of EU countries should intercept &,sink the boats of the traffickers &return the migrants to where they came from.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews   Usual eurocratic rubbish, always someone else's fault but theirs. Leave now!
@BBCBreaking  Actually, those responsible for these deaths are the leaders&people of the countries who destroyed their own nations. Reality.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  dammed if you do and dammed if you don't it seems.

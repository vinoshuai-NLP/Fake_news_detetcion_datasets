@Cosmopolitan  will that be called a 'suicide' if they've been hit by a truck?
@sana_maislahi99 she walked onto the highway to get hit by a truck so yes, it's suicide
@Cosmopolitan  100 yrs later, they're still using religion to justify destroying a group of humans All while claiming  "God loves every1" WTF
@cosmopolitan  Why
@Cosmopolitan  this breaks my heart in so many ways   I don't feel capable of mistreating my child like that. RIP Leelah  Alcorn 
@Cosmopolitan  this is horrible! more ppl need to understand but more importantly ACCEPT PEOPLE FOR WHO THEY ARE! her death won't be in vain
@SonicAngeI did you see the full post & the im sorry post? I went from sad to damn that was a well planned bitch slap
@SonicAngeI same :(
@SonicAngeI yeah I remember you telling me
@SonicAngeI I think that's why I do that too. But yeah those & when I got to her pics I just felt my chest hurt.
@SonicAngeI I've seen a few screen shots of people sending semi hateful texts & some that sounds reasonable then turn into bad texts :(
@Cosmopolitan  @Radicational  SHE WASNT HIT BY A TRUCK

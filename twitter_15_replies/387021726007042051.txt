@hale_razor  LOL. Obama isnt the one who shutdown the govt. Cruz did. #cognitivedissonance
@TinaDesireeBerg  @hale_razor  Congress has the power of the purse,they are they are protecting us from Obama pickpockets.
POS petty #Spitehouse RT  @hale_razor  Cruz stood 21 hours for freedom. Obama won't stand for missing children. #AmberAlert #shutdown
@hale_razor  Cruz is a MAN .. BHO is a vindictive little tyrant.  Loved you tweet!
@hale_razor  @RBPundit  what a cold blooded batard!
Obama is the first Pres who thinks he's above having to negotiate budgets and debt ceilings. No twisted logic.  @TinaDesireeBerg  @hale_razor
@SeahawkBurrrton  @hale_razor  You have now changed the topic. Poor form. Regardless- thats patently false.
Not surprising, cuz I think he's rather incapable, but it certainly puts the blame on him.  @TinaDesireeBerg  @hale_razor
@SeahawkBurrrton  @hale_razor  How does it put blame on him? Why should an extremist minority hold the rest of us hostage? Thats not democracy
One is a Sociopath " @hale_razor : Cruz stood 21 hours for freedom. Obama won't stand for missing children. #AmberAlert #shutdown‚Äù
MT  @hale_razor :  @SenTedCruz  stood 21 hours for freedom. O**** won't stand for missing children. #AmberAlert #shutdown
@hale_razor  Really? You're fucking retarded. The SITE is down, not the entire amber alert program. Fact check.
@hale_razor  @matorres87  doesn't it go both ways?
@hale_razor  ...and Cruz could have helped elect Romney and avoid this alltogether

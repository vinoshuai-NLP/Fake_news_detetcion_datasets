@FoxNews  @GREGinLtown  Brit p##ys? Why you think Isis are in Iraq? Because your dumb ass bush invaded Iraq and our dumb ass Blair followed
@FoxNews  @GREGinLtown  and placing a discriminatory prime minister (anti-Sunnis) In power. Along come ISIS again!
@FoxNews  expect kidnapping and beheadings to ramp up as the us government will need to keep the dumb ass American public in favor of the war

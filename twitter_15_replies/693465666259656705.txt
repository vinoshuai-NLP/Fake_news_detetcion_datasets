@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  turkey foolish country.  Support to Russia for destroy the ISIS.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Shoot it down!!
@BBCBreaking  @BBCWorld  Child Play
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Is an ambassador a new type of anti aircraft system?
@BBCBreaking  shoot it down!
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  turkey say a lot of things.mind you so does Russia
@BBCBreaking  They are not violating, they are just sharing. 
@BBCBreaking  It was not shot down because this was even more deliberate provocation than last time. Someone nuts wants a major war.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  hmmmmn rilly
@BBCBreaking  @BBCWorld  the same Turkey thats accused of financing the terrorists?
. @BBCBreaking  With Chapter 7 in place I'm not sure Turkey has the right to object to Russia using its airspace to fight ISIL & associates.
@BBCBreaking  @LukeDCoffey  34 not a flanker.  They just be messin. Probably didn't even light up the QRA with the s-400
@BBCBreaking ? It happened 30 hours ago. Perhaps you could tell us exactly WHERE the Su-34 trespassed—Same place as the Su-24 they shot down?
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  how could they say that?while their armies fighting in Syria.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Russias gunna keep fuckin around and their poor broke country will end up paying for it
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  again? Vlad >:(  @PutinRF_Eng
@BBCBreaking  @BBCWorld  https://minds.com/velos
@BBCBreaking   the russians need to invest in PGMs those FABs look rubbish
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  why didn't they bring it down like they did previously!!?
@BBCBreaking  uh oh
@BBCBreaking  @BBCWorld  @BBCNews  Russian terrorists
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  All countries should follow suit and shoot down, invading Russian planes and sink intruding ships.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Turkey should shoot them down, but they should crash down in Turkey to prove they were in Turkey.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  this is becoming very fashionable. I'm considering claiming #RussiaInvadedMyAirspace !
@BBCBreaking  shoot it down. Putin never learns!
@bbcbreaking  The summoning of Russian Ambassador by Turkey for violation of airspace by Russian aircraft means trouble!
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Russia what do you want? What's your aim? Peace at world.
@BBCBreaking  http://seflu.com/amberlite-if-if/…
@BBCBreaking  off
@BBCBreaking  @BBC_ua  Erdogan will do anything and say anything to get President Putin to talk to him .
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Not  claim by Turkey.Nato says "A Russian combat aircraft violated Turkish airspace yesterday"
@BBCBreaking  Turkey is ISIS. It's a shame that a Nato member openly supports terrorism
@BBCBreaking  Russia violated Greek airspace. Not turkish occupation's business. turks go back to your own country & moan when Rus. is there.
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  Russian fighter escorts have instructions to pursue and destroy any further Turkish aggression
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  #Turkey routinely violates #Greek airspace looks like they've been getting a taste of their own medicine

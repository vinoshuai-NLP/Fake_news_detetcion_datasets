@HuffingtonPost  -> whoops...
@JuicyChefFood  @HuffingtonPost  understandable but our planet cannot physically support meat eater diets for 7 billion people for much longer
@HuffingtonPost  and????? A surprising number of people eat their boogers too.
@HuffingtonPost -Why wouldn't they? I doubt if cows and steers are their pets, nor are chickens and pigs. Just my opinion!
@HuffingtonPost  I knew it# meat eating vegans.
@HuffingtonPost  They are not then vegetarians; but closet carnivores.
@HuffingtonPost  Meat with salads.
@HuffingtonPost  this is a bogus study, HuffingtonPost should not publish this news
@HuffingtonPost  wheres the link to the study from a coupon website? Are you serious? Try doing research before spouting complete bullshit
@HuffingtonPost  I can't believe anyone believes this. And anyways, if they eat meat at all they aren't vegetarian. Stupid mofo
“ @HuffingtonPost : Surprising number of vegetarians secretly eat meat http://huff.to/1FWP0M4 ” well !
"Many vegetarians secretly eat meat http://huff.to/1FWP0M4" HT  @ddey67  "They're going to have a cow over this.  Oh wait they already are."
@HuffingtonPost  I KNEW IT!
@JuicyChefFood  @HuffingtonPost  I took a gander at your profile and thought you may be interested in #Cowspiracy. It's on netflix. Enjoy! :)
@HuffingtonPost  Then they are not vegetarians.  Research health benefits of meat eaters vs vegetarians.  That's called journalism.
@HuffingtonPost  @islam98630   Yes, is good

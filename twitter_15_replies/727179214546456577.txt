@BreitbartNews  good, keep on losing.
@BreitbartNews  Good news! When you undermine your customers & side with the lefty liberal bully machine,  this is what will happen!No values
@BreitbartNews  I can't shop in a store that I don't feel safe using their restrooms. Any predator can stroll right in and do their thing
@BreitbartNews  @betseyross     Ouch, That Hurts.  @Target
@BreitbartNews  Take the #TargetShoppingCartChallenge !  #Favorite and #RT #Retweet if you like the idea.
@PC_GoneWild  @BreitbartNews  I've done more shopping there since the fear mongering started. Cart abandoning on purpose is chidish.
@BreitbartNews  @Target  Made a huge bad choice for the families they supposedly serve. FAMILIES are important!
@CscBeth  @BreitbartNews  @Target  I quit Target a long time back when  Dollar General opened up 5 minuets away...
@BreitbartNews  @vandives  The liberals can boycott, and we also can.
@BreitbartNews  Too bad liberals have boycotted Target and Walmart as capitalist pigs who aided the disappearance of mom and pop stores. Haa
@BreitbartNews  @JessicaSandu I think the right has found out that you have to vote with your dollars...  about time.
@BreitbartNews  Boycotting online and in store. Moving prescriptions tomorrow.
@BreitbartNews  @TargetStyle  @TargetDeals  @AskTarget  @TargetNews  @TargetMN  NEVER going back! I'm not confused nor plan to harm children
@BreitbartNews   historically stock goes up and down all the time, but twist things as usual to your benefit.

@smashingmag  follow-up question: when will IE11 reach EOL? with EOL of win8.1?  @MicrosoftEdge
@smashingmag  well, sort of true
@smashingmag  On Windows Vista, IE9 is the latest available version and will be supported until April 11, 2017. https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle#gp/Microsoft-Internet-Explorerâ€¦ #IE9
@smashingmag  finally!
@smashingmag  This is only partially correct: IE9 is still supported because Vista.  IE8 and IE10 are fully dropped, though.

@freakonomics  As a cancer patient, I'm in a mental and physical struggle every day. I respect the struggle of others, win or lose.
@jimpeard  Sending blessings and prayers your way.  Get well soon.
@freakonomics  Was this really necessary? Being treated for #Cancer is a "battle" for most with the diagnosis. Truth should not offend you.
@freakonomics  @kick1972  I keep saying that for ages too. You do not lose something you never had a chance to win to begin with.
@freakonomics  thank you soooo much. I have LIVED HAPPILY WITH CANCER FOR 22 years. I do NOT "battle" as in declaring war on my body.
@freakonomics  @keirancoon you don't fight a battle with cancer do much as an insurgency. And you are not the empire.
@freakonomics  RIP the cliche "RIP". Like, you have to abbreviate your condolences?
@freakonomics  @kick1972  Anyone who thinks that way really needs to watch/listen to Stuart Scott's speech https://youtube.com/watch?v=Yl_0ieqSi7Q…
@freakonomics  You can fight the cancer so it doesn't spread to other parts of the body. A battle fought with chemicals and immune system.
@freakonomics  Why is so much of our language tied to war imagery/ winning & losing? Is there any hope of shifting it?
@freakonomics  alternately we could also apply the reasoning that strength and wit often aren't enough for other battles too
@typhoonjim  @freakonomics  “They succumbed after a prolonged battle with Oscar Wilde.” #wit #pleasureisnaturestest
. @freakonomics  @FurryBeta  Totally disagree. In no way does losing a battle (to cancer or otherwise) imply a lack of effort.
. @freakonomics  @FurryBeta  Having watched my partner fight cancer for 2 years, I can say with certainty that "battle" is an appropriate term.
@SDWolf  My bad. Certainly didn't mean imply that Steele wasn't trying. My apologies.
@freakonomics  @freek_braeckman  hear hear!
@freakonomics  @normmacdonald  It implies that he failed and that somebody else that defeated cancer is heroic and courageous. Norm MacDonald
@freakonomics  @KrisPoB  this is worth a watch. Prof Elena Semino talks to  @CR_UK  about the use of cancer metaphors http://youtube.com/watch?v=ckfz-p1Rdjo&sns=tw…

@NME  Keith Richards hasn't commented, but then I don't suppose he remembers the 80s.
@NME  hey  @nilslofgren
@NME  If only he had used it
@NME  @sambrearley
@LUFC1523 no...
@ShaunijeW  @sport_simon  @daverowson   wonder which bright,fair minded and intelligent journo will be first to get interview with  @haighdavid
@DoctorT1992  @WACCOE  @ShaunijeW  @sport_simon  @daverowson  @haighdavid  Martin Kelner is the guy to do it#shaftradioleefs

@ShaunijeW  @WACCOE  @sport_simon  @DoctorT1992  32g to inject mine and they're damn near undetectable unless I hit a bleeder
@ShaunijeW  @WACCOE  @sport_simon  @DoctorT1992  dedication that 
@NME  @scheerbart  No he didn't. He brandished a knife at the promoter who then had to deal with Trump. Richard didn't go near him #OldStory

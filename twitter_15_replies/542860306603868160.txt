@michellemalkin  check the link again - story replaced with editor's note
@michellemalkin  story was taken down..what's it say? Asian minds wanna know..
@michellemalkin  the page states they can not prove anything in their article so they took the story down.
@michellemalkin  This one smells like a very elaborate hoax.  While I don't doubt that edelman is an ass, that "slanty eyed" dog don't hunt
@michellemalkin  - The racist emails were a very nasty hoax, not written or sent by Ben Edelman.
@michellemalkin  So. Suck it up.
@michellemalkin  it takes a douche to know a douche
@michellemalkin  No. U don't have to b a douche 2 know 1. Their behavior towards others says it all.
@michellemalkin  what a dick #hbs #Edelman
@michellemalkin  He's so vain.
@michellemalkin  And he knows these tweets are about him.  He's so vain.
@michellemalkin  Then, he traveled out to Nebraska to see a total eclipse of the Sun (Aug. 21, 2017).  He's so VAIN.
@michellemalkin  @SahilCDesai  well well well these liberal dems are coming out of the closet..about time!
@michellemalkin  @SahilCDesai  so much like Rolling Stone these folks published an unverified article?
@michellemalkin  Are you going to retract your false claim about Edelman - or just pretend it didn't happen?
@michellemalkin  They took it down. Didn't get to see it.
@michellemalkin  you are great
@michellemalkin  Ben Edelman...another good argument for the production of full-Body #condoms.

@stephenfry  @elvis717  Redefines the meaning of 'horny'...
@stephenfry  @elvis717  not true, Stephen.
@stephenfry  I'm laughing but I'm sure I shouldn't. Ouch!
@stephenfry  @elvis717  It's a hoax
@stephenfry  pretty sure this has been debunked as classic strange sex tale circling the Internet for a couple years... Fortunately.
He understood "fucking horny" wrong RT @stephenfry : (...) weirdest fetish I've ever heard of. What was he THINKING of? http://m.ibtimes.co.uk/man-sweden-dies-sex-hornet-s-nest-467900.html…
@stephenfry  @elvis717  I may be kicking in open doors but that is not a true story. The name of the neighbor means erection....
@stephenfry  @elvis717  Perhaps "the birds and the bees" doesn't translate so well into Swedish.
@stephenfry  @elvis717  He actually got as far as an orgasm? The mind boggles!!
@stephenfry  @elvis717  maybe he was hoping to get a buzz
@stephenfry  @elvis717  I would presume that at some point he was thinking "Well this was a stupid idea..." and would question if he was high.
@princesspip  @TLB73  specifically, I want to die aged 93 having too-energetic sex with my 24 year old bride
@stephenfry  Not thinking, methinks
@stephenfry  @elvis717  Another idiot gone.. and mother earth celebrates
@stephenfry  @elvis717  Sex. obviously :)
@stephenfry  we were literally just discussing this at the pub. Clearly he wanted a dangerous lover.
@stephenfry  54 stings to his genitals. That is a brand new level of masochism.
@stephenfry  @elvis717  I'd say he was a Masochist seeking hiw far he could push the boundaries.
@stephenfry  @elvis717  probably he'd heard of tantric sex sessions from sting.
@stephenfry  @elvis717  Unfortunately, it's a fake story. Or fortunately.
@stephenfry  @elvis717  This bit here!!!...."the scrotum was enlarged. Right now it feels heavy and unreal" .
@stephenfry  @elvis717  That puts the "horn" in hornet.
@stephenfry  "To attempt to have intercourse with a hornet's nest is a very bad idea..."  Bit late with that advice, unfortunately.
@stephenfry  sorry, but it has to be fake. The alleged neighbors surname translates into "Boner"
@stephenfry  you may feel a small prick... Bet Sting was glad he wasn't in town.
@stephenfry  NOPE. NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE.
@stephenfry  @elvis717  Never happened. Spoof story started in Sept last year...
@stephenfry  Totally weird man!
@stephenfry  "Having sex with a hornet's nest is a very bad idea" wow I'm glad they asked an expert I wouldn't have thought of this myself...
@stephenfry  Shame you didn't cover fetishes in the F series of QI. Maybe the X series?
@princesspip  @TLB73  given my past history, it’s more likely to be an elaborate wanking accident
@stephenfry  I know, a tattoo on the neck! What was he thinking!
@stephenfry  @elvis717  Horny for hornets
@stephenfry  @elvis717  what the fuck.

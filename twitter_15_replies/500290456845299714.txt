@YourAnonLive  @OpFerguson  $50 ?! Shit.. Mane this is some nonsense the report don't even look right. Missing info allat
@DJ_LSnoogie  “ @OpFerguson  “ @YourAnonLive  Here's the police report. Somehow #Ferguson cops ... http://tmi.me/1eF4ge
“@mskturner10K:  @DeuceTony  @YourAnonLive  @OpFerguson  I bet they just typed that up this morning.” $48.99 is not worth taking a life PERIOD
@YourAnonLive  @OpFerguson  even if it IS 48 dollars, it's still under 50, so it's a misdemeanor. murder is a felony. 
@freewebcamporn  @YourAnonLive  man. in so heated over this
@YourAnonLive  @OpFerguson  could be THE BOX OF SINGLES.  60 or more in box.
@YourAnonLive  your point is invalid http://cigarsinternational.com/cigars/12524/swisher-sweets/…
@YourAnonLive  Hi, Like please) http://ukranews.com/ru/competition/view?id=129…
@YourAnonLive  @FrancoisKilljoy  for real.. I buy a box for 15 bucks.
@agentbell4272  @YourAnonLive  why robbery..whats the difference between shoplift or robbery..I have not read report yet
@YourAnonLive  I think perhaps they’re saying the entire wholesale box a store would use for display…as opposed to one package.
@agentbell4272 right.  So he did that for cigars ? I know I need to sit and read report.   What's your thoughts on sll this
@YourAnonLive  @Mochahontass_  that's not a real police report. 
@YourAnonLive  @euIVmusic  WHY does the time stamp say 11:51 on the report, but one of the stills of the robbery shows 11:53?
@love2livetolove  @YourAnonLive  completely different day
@YourAnonLive  I am so confused by this whole thing right now....
@agentbell4272 indeed. .. I have mixed emotions a young kid us gone but did the officer fear for his safety ?
@YourAnonLive  Am I the only person that see "exceptionally cleared"? Or that the arrived date is the 13th? Or there are NO RECOVED ITEMS?
@agentbell4272 I agree. My Dad way back before he started his company was in law. He was on The riots in Cleveland in the 70d
@YourAnonLive  Time to End Police Militarization Now!
@YourAnonLive  Furthermore...that an INCIDENT REPORT WAS NOT EVEN PRINTED TIL YESTERDAY?
@YourAnonLive  @willeast1  the cops where going by what they could sell them for back at the jail.  They sell them to the inmates.  #profit
@YourAnonLive  And that there are TEN PAGES of this report, but we are only seeing ONE?? I CALLED B.S.!
@agentbell4272  @JillJhorvath  Police will get off. Robbery and used force on clerk with bare hands. He'd be seen as dangerous and a threat.
@YourAnonLive  And INCIDENT reports are public record, so why are these blacked out like a top secret CIA file?? #fergusoncoverup
@Kc2stlchef  @YourAnonLive  @OpFerguson  They are a match. *Graphic-warning* #Stayfocused   http://allhiphop.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/michael-brown-ferguson-shooting.jpg?w=620…
@YourAnonLive  @kyshep_  $30 at the most 
@money_man069  @YourAnonLive  RIGHT
@daeshamonet  ?

@OverAndAround  @TheDailyEdge  I sure have a problem with the fact he was shot multiple times. How many shots does it take to stop a person?
@OverAndAround  @TheDailyEdge  in the back no less
@OverAndAround  @TheDailyEdge  if it wasn't necessary than how can he not be considered a murderer?
@OverAndAround  @TheDailyEdge  lol what witness accounts are these and why shoot multiple times? Police should never shoot to kill an unarmed
@OverAndAround  person
@OverAndAround  @TheDailyEdge  #MikeBrown was sure found guilty and executed before anything was proven
@OverAndAround  @TheDailyEdge  now that constitutes being proven guilty in a court of law?
@OverAndAround  @TheDailyEdge  the chief also said #MikeBrown was stopped because he was walking in the street and that officer knew nothing
@OverAndAround  @TheDailyEdge  of the robbery at that time
@OverAndAround  @TheDailyEdge  and there lies the problem with this
@OverAndAround  @TheDailyEdge  so he deserved to be shot? Again everything points to a police officer using excessive force that resulted in
@OverAndAround  @TheDailyEdge  MURDER!
@OverAndAround  @TheDailyEdge  and that makes officer Wilson a murderer
@OverAndAround  @TheDailyEdge  well, wtf would you call him? #Ferguson
@OverAndAround  @poppaewing  @TheDailyEdge  I bet if the skin color was the other way around, it'd be a different story. #ferguson
@OverAndAround  majority of white people are killed by white people. Get over yourself! #Ferguson
@OverAndAround  I'm referring to your comment.
@OverAndAround  who's us?

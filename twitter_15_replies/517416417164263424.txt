@FoxNews  This craziness needs to be stopped. It's becoming a dictator religion with this join or else attitude.
@FoxNews  the people of #OK will probably be better at serving him justice than the Feds anyway.
@CYNDL  @FoxNews  what's it about then? Please read all of his FB posts and then tell us it's not about his religion.
@FoxNews  No surprise there. How long would his trial take under Muslim law? What would be his punishment?
@FoxNews  I'm glad to live in a country where everyone gets a trial. #freedom
@FoxNews  religion has nothing to do with guilt or innocence you take what the court gives you n work it.
@FoxNews
@FoxNews  I heard they are calling this work place violence like Fort Hood.
@FoxNews  Call him by his real name.
@FoxNews  He's a psycho. Not a terrorist.
@FoxNews  How many morons do we have "working for us" 2 deem this Monster's atrocity work-place violence! Protect the criminal/blame victims!
@FoxNews  keep this case at the state level where he will be executed...why let the feds interfere.
@RichardCSmith4  Chird!  Happy belated 239th brother. Hope you had a great day. Need another way to contact you buddy besides Twitter.
@FoxNews  Surprise, surprise!
@FoxNews  No Shit why the hell would you let this jackass out. I hope he burn in hell.
@FoxNews  I blame the guy who shot him. He should have killed him when he had the chance. Now we as tax payers will pay millions
@FoxNews  of dollars to house, clothes, feed and court costs for what? To kill him in 10+ years after 100 appeals.
@FoxNews  Hmmm sounds ominous. How about held without protection from gators, Mosquitos, and snakes while held to a Cyprus stump. #justice
@FoxNews  I hope so, as he is very evil and will murder again. Not very peaceful from his actions, deeds and words.
wait til holder hears about this!! . @FoxNews  @JNathaniel7
@FoxNews   #offwithhishead
@FoxNews  send his head to Isis. Tell them, the U.S government may be weak, the U.S people are not.
@WaltPimbley  @FoxNews  @instapundit   Wonder if they read that Killer Koran everyday!
@WaltPimbley  @instapundit  @FoxNews  retired
@WaltPimbley  @instapundit  @FoxNews  Not "murderer."
“ @FoxNews : Oklahoma beheading suspect Alton Nolen ordered held without bond http://fxn.ws/10lJcIr ” Behead Him!

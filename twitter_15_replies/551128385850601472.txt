@GMA  I remember watching Ellie May when I was a kid. RIP 
@GMA   I was so lucky to talk to her only 2 months ago for my blog, she was a sweet, kind and generous lady. http://retroladyland.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/you-can-take-girl-out-of-south.html…

@GMA  Elly May has gone to that cement pond in the sky.  RIP, great memories!

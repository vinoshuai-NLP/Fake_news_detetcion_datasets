@Telegraph  simply beautiful
@Telegraph  That's a Vermeer, 'Girl with a Yellow Burglar Alarm'. One of the finest Dutch Golden Age pieces.
@Telegraph  there are so many beautiful murals like this in Reykjavik and they are often commissioned
@Telegraph    stunning!    still graffiti though I suppose  ... wouldn't mind one on my house though
@Telegraph  is the burglar alarm supposed to be an eating? Maybe.!
@Telegraph  ear ring..!
@Telegraph  Amazing!!!!!
@Telegraph  "Girl With The ADT Earring" - doesn't roll off the tongue as easy but a stunning piece of artwork!

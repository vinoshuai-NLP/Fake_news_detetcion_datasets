.@IamDonCheadle  @Gawker  @LibyaLiberty  Seriously, I'm a white guy from Wyoming and this shit is RIDICULOUS. Round these clowns up! #YallQaeda
@Gawker  @Glinner  I would suggest a fitting name would be calling them 'terrorists' and not 'militiamen'.
@CampbellLetters  @Gawker  @Glinner  unoccupied, terrorist. These words don't fit together.
@IamDonCheadle it goes without saying. they won't even let a black man take over the white house, legally.
“ @Gawker : Oregon militiamen receive fitting nickname: #YallQaeda http://gaw.kr/OthCft9 ” #YallQaeda LMAO
@Gawker  @Bill_Owen  #VanillaISIS coined by  @adamdm4  wins for me.
@Gawker  @pdx_shane  YeeHawd
#YallQaeda is good. I prefer #VanillaISIS  @Gawker
@Clarknt67  @Gawker  I think we can use them interchangeably. Just as long we continue to call them #terrorists. #YallQaeda #VanillaISIS
@Gawker  #gawker is a pathetic joke that is just out for clicks
@Gawker  Really? My friend calls them #WHISIS.
@M_Qtips  @Gawker  hilarious
@brandonmac613  @oolon_aquinas  @Gawker  it's an American word, if nothing else. It's perfect

. @WomenForTrump  @Gawker  HAHA! Awesome.
. @WomenForTrump  @Gawker  BTW you totally blew your "Women For Trump" cover with this. A real Trump troll could never say anything so clever.
@Gawker  @WashCoScanner  fitting my ass
@matthew_hand  @WilliamRLBaker  not trying to create a narrative. asked you a question about your tweet, you answered, that's it for me.
@ChuckBaggett  @Gawker  @TeaJunkie1  I'm an Oregonian. They are terrorists.
@Gawker  @Glinner  Because the alternative name would be al Bundy.
@Gawker  @Glinner  A lot of people going with #VanillaIsis
@Gawker  @BuhByeGOP  hilarious!
@Gawker  @BuhByeGOP  Terrorists

@Gawker  @katylied67  Interesting that #militias only rear their heads during #Democratic presidencies.
@ZaidJilani  @IamDonCheadle  @Gawker  they certainly have a stronger case.
@ZaidJilani  @IamDonCheadle  @Gawker  sorry, which claims?
@LibyaLiberty  @ZaidJilani  @IamDonCheadle  @Gawker  they didn't occupy spaces in this manner, with this type of weaponry, did not spout hate

“ @washingtonpost : Donald Trump is the least favorably viewed presidential candidate since at least 1992 http://wapo.st/1Q2sPCV” Guauuu
@washingtonpost  @pbump   America is in a complete Turmoil. Communism is trying to take over. People are Brainwashed. Wake Up America!
@washingtonpost   nice chart, most people go for this BS
@washingtonpost  The important thing is Trump will make this country strong again
@washingtonpost  then who are all these people packing the house an dining up outside the doors to see him everywhere he campaigns?
@washingtonpost  *lining
@washingtonpost  @KeithOlbermann  @pbump  then why is he leading every poll?
@washingtonpost  @KeithOlbermann  @pbump  look who else is down there with him it's  @HillaryClinton
@washingtonpost  @aymr_   Gallup did this!
@Dion_Jayy1  @washingtonpost  my job means something :')
@washingtonpost  He really doesn't get it. Give US companies a level playing field. GE has more than 300,000'employees. Punish GE, repatriate
@washingtonpost  @KeithOlbermann  And he's reached the highest level of #douchebaggery!
@washingtonpost : "Donald Trump is the least favorably viewed presidential candidate since at…" #1 in United States
@washingtonpost  @maguirekevin  Of course he is, amongst anyone with a functioning brain in their head...
@washingtonpost  I wonder why?
@washingtonpost  @KeithOlbermann  unreal 4 of the other 6 worst won.
@washingtonpost  @pbump  he's "winning" amongst a split field. He's still unpopular with most Americans. Passionate but narrow support base.
@washingtonpost  @KeithOlbermann  @pbump  "Vote for me!  I suck less!"
@washingtonpost  @KeithOlbermann  Ransom of Red Chief, America. #PonyUp
@washingtonpost  Thank goodness it is mercifully so. The man is evil
@Wailingvoice  @washingtonpost  still the fact that he is that close to ruling the leader of the free world is very worrying.
@washingtonpost  YES But base your poll on reasons. Like have one on, lack of intellectual capacity and see how trump does. &  lying bullies?
@washingtonpost  @deray  @pbump  interesting. Besides Obama in 08 you have to be over 40% anyway to get elected president.
@washingtonpost  @pbump  well that's the best news I read today!!!
@washingtonpost  @pbump  He is leading the polls and Billary isn't far behind him in the likability department.

@zellieimani  It's easier to manipulate pictures than a video.
@zellieimani  is that even him in the stills?
@LashawnaTaylor  @zellieimani  look at the shoes
To not telegraph their court case “ @zellieimani : If there is surveillance of a robbery why release stills and not video itself? #Ferguson”
@zellieimani  That's what you got from those looks like some1 pushing an old lady around.... no?
@zellieimani  maybe they will do like 911 and cut out frames
“ @jsmith189  Video manipulation takes time. RT  @zellieimani  If there's surveillance of a robbery why release stills & not video? #Ferguson.”

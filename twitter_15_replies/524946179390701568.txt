Stay safe, Ottawa. RT  @CBCNews  - UPDATE: Attacker shot dead in Parliament after soldier shot at National War Memorial http://cbc.ca/1.2808710
@CBCNews  hopefully there were no other gunmen!
@CBCNews  @JSB_FOX  still working on clearing building. Possible others.
@CBCNews  bet he's a Muslim convert
@CBCNews  perhaps reporters and witnesses should not reveal where MPs and the PM have taken cover. Too much info
@CBCNews  #soldier thank God one shooter down. How many more?   Get them all!!! Why do u come to Canada??  Keep away from us!
@CBCNews  please spread the word to not display or tell police positions and police doings.  #KeepATightLidMedia thank you.

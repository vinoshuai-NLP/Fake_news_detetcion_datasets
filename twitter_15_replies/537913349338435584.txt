@LeftSentThis  @HicklenJeremiah Happy Thanksgiving to you folks out there. That is unavoidable in a street protest gone mob rampage!
@LeftSentThis  @HicklenJeremiah you can't have massive riots and chaos and not expect some casualties...
@rene_norton  @LeftSentThis  we would wait but... We've been waiting since the 1800s
@LeftSentThis  ok what's the full story? It's hard to believe she was a innocent bystander.
@LeftSentThis    Oh my God. Hang in there sweetheart.
@LeftSentThis  Nerf, or nothing!
@NotMyName36  @Abstract_cool  @LeftSentThis  I didn't make it up.  There is dash cam footage and many articles online.
@NotMyName36  @Abstract_cool  @LeftSentThis  I read the legal pleadings and the police report, but I can't seem to find them online now.
@NotMyName36  @Abstract_cool  @LeftSentThis  She had already hit a police car & off camera were other police in danger ....
@NotMyName36  @Abstract_cool  @LeftSentThis  .... whether she pulled forward or backwards, they believed she would run over them.
@NotMyName36  @Abstract_cool  @LeftSentThis  Here's the dashcam footage. She was 3x the legal limit. http://fox13now.com/2014/11/13/woman-who-lost-eye-after-police-chase-ended-in-gunfire-sues-morgan-county/…

@Telegraph  And tasked with investigating Charlie Hebdo shooting. But 'obviously' just a strange coincidence. Not like he discovered anything
@Telegraph  @TelegraphNews  Don't worry...it's all another weird coincidence. No conspiracy here.
@Telegraph  horrible!!! Needless. Did Dubya kill himself after 9/11 or just go brain-dead...
@Telegraph  Am sure he touched at the height of self accountability which is rare.I feel grief and pain of his loss. #Mayhissoulrestinpeace.
@Telegraph  Why?
@Telegraph  we will be very satisfied if #NawazSharif resigns. Here they hide the reports which blames them.
@Rene_gadeCowboy  @Telegraph . Nothing to see here. Move along.

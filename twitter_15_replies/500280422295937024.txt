@Yamiche  In case you haven't been told enough, you've done a fantastic job covering this story. Really great work.
@Yamiche  I'm sure they covered up all his disciplinary actions. They've had almost a week to set up a defense strategy!
6 years is a "veteran"? “ @Yamiche : Darren Wilson is a six year veteran of the #Ferguson Police and had no disciplinary actions against him.”
Translation: killing unarmed teen his first. MT  @Yamiche : Darren Wilson 6-yr vet of #Ferguson Police w/ no disciplinary actions against him.
@Yamiche  @USATODAY   yamiche. you didnt get this topic cause your black right?  i hope its of your enduring work ethic
@Yamiche  @USATODAY  im sure none of the  officers in #fergurson have any infractions against them........
@Yamiche  @USATODAY  Can we see video proof
“ @Yamiche : Darren Wilson is a six year veteran of the #Ferguson Police and had no disciplinary actions against him.”

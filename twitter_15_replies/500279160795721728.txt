@DanteB4u  Why didnt they just do it since its such a simple request?
@DanteB4u  @MsRock4Ever  Looks like the first lie!
@DanteB4u  Why didn't they came out with the strong arm robbery call theory right then? BS cover up I say. REVOLUTION NOW!
@DanteB4u  @MarkMC9  are they calling Mike Brown a suspect? If so, why didn't he stop them and check them?
@napps126  @DanteB4u  I'm all types of confused.
@DanteB4u  @num1_fan  that's what they took 4 days to concort ?...those 2 situations don't seem related at all
@iloanya1  @DanteB4u  @num1_fan  They had 2 splice some tapes together.
Agreed-also,if #MikeBrown was suspect,why not just question him? Why tell him & friend get off road,not stop them?  @danteb4u  #bsDetector
@DanteB4u  Another question, how would the police engage a suspect from INSIDE his vehicle? And, why not question 2nd suspect?
@DanteB4u  theve acted the same even over a bag of chips
@kristacole17  @DanteB4u  Wilson's story doesn't hold water. He was not stopping teens for questioning, but telling them to get out of road ?
@ErinTaylor14  @DanteB4u  @JamesEFaubel  @DarkMission1  This  crap from PD Chief w/only make things worse, no matter who the hell is in charge
@DanteB4u  My same question! !!
Social Media and News in general,  has me so sad today!  So much happening
@DanteB4u  @MsRock4Ever  good question
@DanteB4u  question, if they were just walkin in the street minding their business then why would mike go after the cops gun? i can do that 2
@DanteB4u  because you ignorant too if you think he just drove up and said, oh im going to kill this nigger, and shot him for nothing. stupid
@DanteB4u  @jljacobson  Nothing that they are saying makes sense

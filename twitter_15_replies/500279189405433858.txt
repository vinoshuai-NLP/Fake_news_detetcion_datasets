@chrisnmartin  @godivapearl14  @edeweysmith  so the ? Becomes, why is this impt to his murder? Less innocent=kool to kill?
@chrisnmartin  @edeweysmith  are the still pictures are at the Quicktrip about some cigars/candy or the liquor store?
@chrisnmartin  @edeweysmith  if they were both suspects in a robbery, why wasn't JOHNSON arrested or taken inti custody?
@edeweysmith  Come on now.......#openminds
@chrisnmartin  @godivapearl14  @edeweysmith  if that's what makes you feel better about #MikeBrown's murder.....
@chrisnmartin  @edeweysmith  I don't deal in what ifs. Further, the fact that it took a week to tell us something makes me more suspicous.
@chrisnmartin  @godivapearl14  @edeweysmith  u r right! We don't kno what happened, but your overwhelming desire to believe the police, whew!
@edeweysmith  of course because they want to try and make black people look as bad as possible and worth them killing.
@chrisnmartin  @edeweysmith  @jmccray  I'm sorry that is not the same person on all those pic -   body types are totally different
@chrisnmartin  @delisag  @edeweysmith  I totally agree!!!
“ @edeweysmith : That was very "SLICK" of the Police Chief to create a narrative that #MikeBrown was a "suspect" in a robbery!  #Ferguson”
@chrisnmartin  @edeweysmith  @jmccray  I get that but the body types are different in the images/my son dad is 6'4- muscle boys vs big boys
@chrisnmartin  @edeweysmith  @jmccray  not the same - the 1st 3 the guy is muscle the last he big boy - just doesn't look the same to me 
@chrisnmartin  @edeweysmith  @jmccray  exactly my point a muscle bound guy shows chest-wise /big guy has softer shoulders round in belly
@edeweysmith  So they shot him 8 times because he was a "suspect"? Still doesn't make any sense.
@chrisnmartin  @edeweysmith  @jmccray  exactly..Not saying I can't be wrong but I know big guys/ kiddo dad is muscle big- it's 2 different guys
@edeweysmith  There's NO excuse for this senseless MURDER!!

@aenk963  @BlogsofWar  yes, but CSIS can't watch that many 24/7
@aniekan_o  sure looks like one
@20committee  Oh, so they already know where Z-B had gone to? Any travels to the Levant recently?
@chrisjefferson  no info yet
@20committee  @BlogsofWar  How come we have to pussy foot around terrorism for hours before calling what it is.
@20committee  Pathetic.
@20committee  @sqwerin  and  @BarackObama  still refuses to call it terrorism!
@20committee  @AresXtra  They must put high risk travelers in civilian detaine camps to prevent attacks.US does this with suspect japs in WWII
@20committee  @kshaidle  It makes more sense to let them leave, and invalidate their passports before they return.

Did she say *meow* that MJ kills?
So is that why your daddy NEVER inhaled? Gotcha!!
yes, because "anecdotal evidence" is the scientific gold standard. And an N=1 makes a compelling case 
CORONER: autopsy shows the deceased was maxing, relaxing, likely crossfaded. CoD: failed to check himself before he wrecked himself
I have the impression Chelsea was raised to fear everything. She's near 40 and ain't broke free yet.
There is indeed a mountain of research done by government entities including the DEA and the FDA which concludes the opposite.
she's doing the wink wink, nod nod to big pharma for her mother.
. @lhfang  She needs a president who understands the human cost of the predatory drug war.  @ChelseaClinton
I'dk the context, but if you have an agenda you can link anything to anything if you want, it's how all the vaccine insanity began
Only if you don't inhale it.
Good god. She's a mini-Hillary. Did Bill have anything to do with this? @theharryshearer  @lhfang

I have a better chance at being killed by  @HillaryClinton  than marijuana.
can't have any cutting into the #ClintonCrimeFamily cash flow.
I can't believe some actually call her "sweet." What a joke, she would be an absolute nobody if it weren't for her criminal parents
this is profoundly stupid
hold on. In the full clip she says "drug interactions...that were hella sick; we know they died happy cause drugs rule."
it can, just like alcohol, salt and sugar can
you could trip over some marijuana and fall into a well
@amsomniac  @lhfang  that's how my cousin died
Alcohol has drug interactions and that's still legal. Not a good argument against marijuana.
grapefruit has drug interactions
She said there are suspected drug-interaction deaths, which is a legitimate risk because of bleeding http://mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/marijuana/interactions/hrb-20059701â€¦
exposing a Clinton is much more dangerous
@uberyacht of course she did cause #ClintonCash gets $ from booze lobby #NeverHillary #Revolution
Well, really, who actually listens to this sheltered, boring child?
tell that to the guy who was crushed to death under a 10,000 lb crate full of dank Ganja. Insensitive!
@EmmaVigeland  I see where she gets her know it all phony from.
.  @lhfang  insecure much Lee? are you injecting the grass???
. @lhfang  @ZaidJilani  She's ignorant. She also argued to  @davidsirota  that Bernie's de-incarceration push was dangerous.
you're more likely to be killed by a Clinton than marijuana
. Marijuana won't kill anyone, but her mother's policies surely will. #NeverHillary
Actually Chelsea Clinton will kill you if you listen to her
she say anything about her old man drug running that and worse when he was Governor of AK?
never knew he held same position in Alaska
Drug interactions are something people should take seriously. My physician prescribed me migraine meds that could kill me w/my meds.
I will tell you what I have yet to see having a serious interaction with marijuana. I always check but have never run into an issue

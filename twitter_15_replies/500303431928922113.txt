@PrisonPlanet  NOTHING justifies militarized police pointing sniper rifles at anyone #fixed
@PrisonPlanet  or pointing any weapon at any non-combatant
You misspelled citizens.  @PrisonPlanet  @SlavLibertarian
@PrisonPlanet  at anyone!
@PrisonPlanet  @dollaranarch  what about drone killing innocent bystanders that are near an alleged bad guy? We turn cheek No Twitter outrage
@PrisonPlanet  Not simply a title: Journalists, but CITIZENS, Paul. Everyday USA People/CITIZENS protesting Police MURDER/Subterfuge!  --GBJ
@PrisonPlanet  minor looting? Didn't they burn down a store?
@PrisonPlanet  Journalists, poor and the homeless are not Royalty.
@PrisonPlanet  MINOR LOOTING? LOL
@PrisonPlanet  theyd beg to differ.  Supression of journalism is supression of coverage, or so it was assumed.
@PrisonPlanet  new bill Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement act drafted yesterday http://hankjohnson.house.gov/sites/hankjohnson.house.gov/files/assets/Stop%20Militarizing%20Law%20Enforcement%20Act.pdfâ€¦
@PrisonPlanet  I say even before journalists, CITIZENS! but now the journalists can put light on the situation, it's all across the U.S.
. @PrisonPlanet  Is that why you guys posted TONS of photos of looters on the first day this story broke? You're so much like the MSM you hate

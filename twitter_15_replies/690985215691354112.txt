@MSNBC  WOW!! Breaking news! I'm sure he meant it literally...Wonder how many folks he's shot already! It's called making a point not murder!
@MSNBC  but we know you're all talk and don't have the stones to do it
@MSNBC  @realDonaldTrump  #DumpTrump #Embarrassment
@MSNBC
@TaylorLaslo  @MSNBC  UR prolly rite.  Who cares?
@MSNBC  Nothing wrong with STRONG self-esteem. Eat LOTS of garlic & onion on pizza today during 2016 Blizzard 
@MSNBC  it may have been a joke but it was a bad one #Trump
@MSNBC
@MSNBC  He could stand in the middle of 5th Ave and shoot himself and gain mine.
@MSNBC  @cpaschali
@MSNBC  - Cue the pearl clutching!
#VOTE  to expel and #boycott #climatedenier #racist #bigoted #misogynist #fascist #Trump AND supporters/#media/#advertisers    @MSNBC
@MSNBC  That is Strange
@TaylorLaslo  @MSNBC  I wish Law school would've taught me to right properly.  I wonder how I made an A in Constitutional Law rightin so pore
@MSNBC   turn it to your self please !
@MSNBC  this guy is motherf***ing nuts.
@MSNBC  people laughed? He and all his supporters need to be set on a melting iceberg
@msnbc  HELLO!!! This is the kind of language DICTATORS use (if they're given power)!!!  @GOP  @thedemocrats  #TrumpIsDangerous
@MSNBC  And he's proud of that?!
@MSNBC  Am I supposed to not vote for Trump because he believes he could shoot someone without losing voters? No.
@JenkinsWritings  @MSNBC  no Dt is just saying his voters are idiots who could care less if he kills ppl
@MSNBC   What an arrogant stupid thing to say. Sadly some people would still support him.
@TaylorLaslo  @MSNBC  Disgruntled Clerk? Love it when a miserable unhappy person (probably unemployed) wants to correct someone else.
@MSNBC  This is definitely a Democrat telling us how stupid Republican voters are. He's clearing a path for Hillary but they can't see it.
@Autumnchild68  @MSNBC  Trump was quoting someone else....
@MSNBC  @Clarknt67  Rest of quote: "My supporters are just that stupid! They don't care that I'm a total phony!"
"There are perks to being cult leader!"  @realDonaldTrump  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  @fred_burton15  @MSNBC

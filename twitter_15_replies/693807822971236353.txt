@CNN  @JohnKingCNN  @BernieSanders   @CNNPolitics  it's doesn't get anymore serious than that of Hillary and those security  breaches
@CNN  @BernieSanders  @HillaryClinton  a month ago sanders didn't care about the email issue.. two faced!
@CNN  @BernieSanders  @HillaryClinton  I thought Bernie defended Hillary's emails in their debate. What made him to change.
@CNN  @BernieSanders  @HillaryClinton  Is there any way we can focus on more important issues? Her emails will not fix the country.
@CNN  @BernieSanders  @HillaryClinton  It is about time you bring it to the table #FBI and #POTUS will delay it
@CNN  @BernieSanders  @HillaryClinton  Bernie is desperate;now wants to talk negative about the e-mails. We do not care about her "damn" emails
@CNN  @AsheSchow  @BernieSanders  @HillaryClinton  wow, equating student debt (rich kids who got to go to college) with unaffordable healthcare
@CNN  @BernieSanders  @HillaryClinton  whata flip flop
@CNN  @BernieSanders  @HillaryClinton  Can be "VERY SERIOUS" and not important to the nation for purposes of electing a POTUS at same time.
@CNN  @BernieSanders  @HillaryClinton  YES we know Sanders but you are sick of hearing about it, Remember? Trump2016 lets put Hillary in prison
@CNN  @BernieSanders  @HillaryClinton  I find it interesting that he didn't care before and now he does.... Hmmmm
@CNN  @BernieSanders  @HillaryClinton  HOW SERIOUS? She has been waiting for these emails to come out? Mr. Bernie just now serious?
@CNN  @BernieSanders  @HillaryClinton  Does "Enough with the damn emails" ring a bell Bernie?
@CNN  @BernieSanders  @HillaryClinton  @JohnKingCNN  Not so "authentic" Bernie....typical political flip-flop
@Politicodivers2  @CNN  @BernieSanders  @HillaryClinton  @JohnKingCNN  Did you watch it? Said there is a legal process & he won't poltisize it!!
@CNN  @BernieSanders  @HillaryClinton  . So Bernie, because it benefits you, you now want to hear about her "damn emails."  Pathetic, Bernie.
@CNN  @BernieSanders  @HillaryClinton  THIS   IS  ALL HILLARY  OWN  DOING,  AND  TO  LIE,  AND  LIE ,  ANND  LIE,  # DID  I  SAY  LIE ?

@CNN  @BernieSanders
@CNN  @BernieSanders  @HillaryClinton  @CNNPolitics  No chit Sherlock.  Shows ur lack of judgement.  And I take u over Killary.
@CNN  @BernieSanders  @HillaryClinton  @CNNPolitics  Bernie is jumping on the GOP bandwagon.  VOTE Bernie 4 GOP
@CNN  @BernieSanders  @HillaryClinton  Thank gosh he said something. If he really loves America, he will blast Hillary.
@CNN  @JohnKingCNN  @BernieSanders  @HillaryClinton  Now it's a serious issue? Hillary is unfit to lead.
@CNN  @BernieSanders  @HillaryClinton  @CNNPolitics

@CNN  @BernieSanders  @HillaryClinton
@CNN  @BernieSanders  @HillaryClinton  It saddens me that Bernie has resorted to playing dirty.
@CNN  @TarekFatah  @BernieSanders  @HillaryClinton  comrades.
@CNN  @BernieSanders  Sir you are ready for Indian Politics now..
@CNN  @BernieSanders  @HillaryClinton   We don't care about emails. She is the most qualified so far, in my own opinion...
@CNN  @BernieSanders  @HillaryClinton  Wait. What?  "We thought nobody cared about your damn emails."
@CNN  @BernieSanders  @HillaryClinton  https://youtu.be/q_2ibSdURBs #makemoneyonline #makeextramoney #workfromhome
@CNN   @BernieSanders  @HillaryClinton  @CNNPolitics  "it will play out, im not gonna politicize it" became Sanders: "emails are srsbzns"
@CNN  @CNNPolitics  but 3 debates ago  @BernieSanders  said that  @HillaryClinton  emaila weren't that important but now it is? I wonder why?

@BBCBreaking  what the hell were they testing. A drug for?
@BryceBarrows  @BBCBreaking  because they need to know if it works on humans, if they didn't test it then it would be public now in this form
@BBCBreaking  how very sad
@BBCBreaking  shame we cannot test it out on the Tory Government first !

@BBCBreaking  what kind of drug?
@BBCBreaking  Drugs don't work they make you worse
@pauljohno11  
@BBCBreaking  can they give it to the bastards who stole tools from my van last night
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  That is the risk you take when you do a clinical trial. Hope they all recover.
@BBCBreaking  j
@Max_Hallam  man..... I guess we wait and see what the reports have to say.  @BBCBreaking
@BBCBreaking  @BBCWorld  @ people now the preferred guinea pigs@animals don't give scientists the thrill of the kill anymore
@Max_Hallam  @BryceBarrows  @BBCBreaking  unconfirmed reports which the French health ministry has outright denied
@fuckoffcoldplay  @BryceBarrows  @BBCBreaking  What do you think it actually is, then?
@bbcbreaking   Al shabab must end

@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  what kinda crazy shit did they do to make a "Cannabis based drug" kill someone? and why? Pot is fine the way it is!!!
Drugs should be tested first in cell cultures of  all 240 types of human cells That fail was probably predictable this way @BBCBreaking
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  only trial I could find that might fit the bill is NCT02479204. An S1PR1 modulator.
@BBCBreaking  #clinicaltrail #cannabinoids i doubt it had anything to do with the cannabinoids itself
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  before start a trial u know the risks...people are happy with tax free cash but an uproar wen it goes wrong
@BBCBreaking  @BBCNews  people could have alergic to cbd or thc..did they try other cannabis first ??

@mashable  nonwhite? Is this tweet for publicity?
@mashable  kind of racism, xenophobia and hate speech
@mashable  tonight talent was appreciated and the winners were so humble n deserving of their awards.#SAGsSoBlack #SAGAwards2016 #diver
@mashable  adi Gail armah
@mashable  
@mashable  they're black
@mashable  non-white?  Really?  No man.
What's up with the "non white"  " @mashable : Nonwhite actors nearly swept every nominated category at the #SAGAwards http://on.mash.to
@mashable  your headline is lame. You really just should've written "African American" or better yet, highlighted diversity 
@mashable  Why is that news? Someones gotta win.
@mashable  12% of the US population are black. 50% of the individual acting awards when to black actors (100% winrate). " #SAGSoDiverse "
@mashable  good
@jen_yeager  @mashable  well said, and it has also be said some people too!
@mashable  @JakesLipbalm Apropos response to all the #OscarsSoWhite defenders. There would be no uproar if it was not so blatantly unfair.
@jen_yeager  @mashable  I think it will...maybe 100 years from now when FAIRNESS is equally applied.
@mashable  @moorehn  did the really win, or...er...
. @mashable  @moorehn  Congrats to them all, but at same time glad  @DowntonAbbey  won. Seems to be overlooked a bit amongst the great shows.

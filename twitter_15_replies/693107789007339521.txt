@WhiteHouse  would  @HillaryClinton  get paid less if elected?
@WhiteHouse    from România    
@WhiteHouse  YEAH RIGHT YOU TELL OBAMA THAT AND he WILL TAKE MORE JOBS AWAY.
@WhiteHouse  100% correct!
@WhiteHouse  they should, in fact it should be illegal to do otherwise…oh wait, it is
@WhiteHouse  agreed, assuming same actually means equal pay for equal work. Like education, experience, performance & ability gets the same $
@mrkevinconroy  @WhiteHouse  you should be paid equally PER JOBi.e.,same job same pay. Qualifications are assumed to be equal for the same job
@WhiteHouse  they already do...
@WhiteHouse  should get paid for ability.Not affirmative action method
@WhiteHouse   They do. In fact, they initially earn more in STEM. http://archive.aacu.org/ocww/volume39_1/feature.cfm?section=1…
@WhiteHouse  Wait,if women are paid less for doing the same work then why would any one hire a man? #badbusinessdecisions
@WhiteHouse  They do get paid the same.
@WhiteHouse  the $1.00 -$0.79 comparison is not based on valid statistical analysis.  @freakonomics  http://bit.ly/1n6eZbD. #GetTheFacts
@WhiteHouse  that's true
. @WhiteHouse  start with your own house then since women in obama regime are not equally paid HYPOCRITES
@WhiteHouse  Not sure, but generally everywhere it seems women have more cushy jobs than men.
@WhiteHouse  Sure, IF they do the same work. Men generally are more efficient bricklayers, construction workers, and firemen.
@WhiteHouse  this disparity doesn't account for women dropping out of the market to rear children
@WhiteHouse  sign them up for the draft and give me my lifeboat seat before your daughter.
@WhiteHouse  Patently false as the analysis does not account for career and life CHOICES.
@WhiteHouse  prove it. Bullshit bar graph made in 5 min on a 10yr old computer. Show what jobs and what labor this happens in, COMPLETE LIE
@WhiteHouse  ..and The White House should stick with using real studies, not this fake bullshit. It's just like when Obama promised us real -
@WhiteHouse  change, and then fought the promised public option with all that he had. Expect people to know better than this.
@WhiteHouse  go after Hollywood Mr. President, they are guilty of this as well.
A question the  @WhiteHouse  won't answer: If employers could truly pay women 21% less for equal work, why would ANY employer EVER hire men?!?
@WhiteHouse  What's the male vs female pay scale in the WH, Congress, & rest of government for equal work, ed, etc is it the same ?
@WhiteHouse  @Donna_West   Yes!....Equal pay for equal work!>>
@WhiteHouse  They do...it's already the law. Moving on....
@WhiteHouse  @GreatDismal  *cough* http://kjlr.it/1VvLpHA
@WhiteHouse  They already do. I guess Obama has been too busy partying and golfing to familiarize himself with the law.
@WhiteHouse  @rabianazir01  I support it.... but why is it so????

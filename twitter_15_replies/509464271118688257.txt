@BreakingNews  @BrowncoatPony  @WSJ  I can see it now: Minecraft: brought to you by Mountain Dew and Doritos. If you want any tools, order DLC.

@BreakingNews  @WSJ  they'll probably ruin Minecraft.
@BreakingNews  @CollinPotato  @WSJ  Must be reversing eula to save a few servers :o
@BreakingNews  @WSJ  Are they going to make it an Xbox Exclusive?

@BreakingNews  @WSJ  If this happens, Microsoft better not alter anything! Imagine First thing u see on minecraft MICROSOFT!!!and DRM junk

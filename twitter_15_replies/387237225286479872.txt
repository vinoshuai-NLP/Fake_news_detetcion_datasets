@SteveWorks4You  Epic fail
@SteveWorks4You  @365conservative  This admin has been in a state of concealed confusion since January 2009. It's time to take out the trash.
@SteveWorks4You  Hilarious and scary as hell!  Thanks for tweeting. #SpiteHouse
Which is why it's so essential to #MakeDCListen !  @SteveWorks4You  @ebpolitical
@SteveWorks4You  @WickedHuntress  And they want to run Nationalized health care...
Code word for Socialized Medicine people are so easily fooled!  @donmoody5  @SteveWorks4You
@SteveWorks4You  If Ocare were such a great idea it would be voluntary.
@SteveWorks4You  @2nd_To_None  #OBarryKare "confusion" may also empty yur bank account OOPS! try to get it back n they'll tax U on tht too!
@SteveWorks4You  @DawnRiseth  Who cares if little children are abducted or injured or even killed!? Shutting down #AmberAlert will show them!
@SteveWorks4You  @DawnRiseth  Get all government OUT of healthcare!
@SteveWorks4You  at least they didn't shut down the government like you did
@SteveWorks4You  @Longwoodct  are they that confused?
@SteveWorks4You  @Fritzster  Actually, they did NOT shut down THE Amber alert site.
@SteveWorks4You  @Tundraeyes  He did it for 'The Children'
@BudWII  @SteveWorks4You  Yea, he's wacked for sure. No reason for him to be in office anymore. Time he leaves here.
@dave_mears  @SteveWorks4You  That's another reason we have to fight them every step of the way. No socialism in our country. Ever.
@dave_mears  @SteveWorks4You  I would have to say in all honesty, it's what the American ppl allow them to do. I pray everyone wakes up soon.
@1_Eagle  @_Avocet  @SteveWorks4You  Cruz gets his insurance from his wife. No wonder that pill sticks in the throat.

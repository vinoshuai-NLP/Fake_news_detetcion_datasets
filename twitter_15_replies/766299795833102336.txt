great!
was Brazil dq
yeah I heard .. thanks lol
the baton of the gringas invaded the other team's lane. Period.
Hell yeah!!  She was bumped by that other runner.
it was a clear DQ. What a joke
not fair that they replace #CHN who may have been able to run faster, but just ran as fast as necessary. Should be 9 teams #relay
rigged game. Pure politics. Long live Rio Olympic!
shame
How about letting all athletes who had false start rematch too? We might as well reinstate all the games where US didn't win.
strange.so strange.
this is so disgusting
It is not fair！！just one team?compete against yourself?Where are your faces?it's a complete joke!
ridiculous
it's a joke. Lucky they're not asking running alone for the gold.
They lost!
good, finally some justice.  @allysonfelix  I love you. #BlackGirlMagic
justice? New word 4 loser?
whining Americans
are fucking kidding me? what complete bullshit. they made a mistake. why arent the dutch team being given the same opportunity
Shame on them, cheaters.
@cnni  they dropped the baton end of. If they win its a fiddle

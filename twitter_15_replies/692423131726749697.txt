@latimes  remember visiting in 1992. No bird song. Such a terrible thing that happened there. I'll never forget the feeling of sorrow.
@latimes  @RyanABlack  visited there 10 years ago...very powerful visit if you ever get the chance
@aahlaw  Unfortunately I have not. I need to go, though.
@latimes  my thoughts go out to the people and families affected...#howcouldthishappen
@latimes  a city of death that officially lowers its death tolls and retracts original claims on an almost annual basis
@latimes  @alfonslopeztena  Russian army did
@latimes  @alfonslopeztena  and Germans leds the nazi camps, not palestinians
@latimes  @alfonslopeztena  this place is testament to how man can do the vilest things. Years may pass but we'll never forget the lives lost.
@latimes
@latimes  That's so Amazing! :)
@latimes  That's Great! :)
@latimes  YES, AND I ONCE HEARD THAT BLACK SOLDIERS DID THIS. IS THIS TRUE?

@FoxNews  Thanks #Obama! Another #terrorist getting paid by the #government! Slap in the face of the deceased #SOLDIERS!! #ActOfTerror! #USA
@FoxNews  @BuckMcKeon  Why is this murderer being paid? He is a terrorist and belongs at Guantanamo. He has no rights - this is shameful.
@FoxNews  politics how things are same that  @SpeakerBoehner  votes himself to get 240 vocation days in 2013 weres outrage?
@FoxNews  this really upsets me an the victims are being denied benifits,honorable sacrafice medals,medical services, his bank grows more :(
@FoxNews  burn him at the stake!
@FoxNews  I was at Fort Knox when that happened and it has been over 3 years now. They need to get this resolved. #ArmyStrong
@FoxNews  I guess crime pays.
@FoxNews  Why has it taken 3-4 years to have a trial?
@FoxNews  what the hell that's horrendous  have the politicians gone bonkers
@FoxNews  should b donated to the families of those he murdered!
@jagair  @FoxNews Yep. Until dischargered from service he is still employed and he has to stay in service until after his trail.
Probably funding terrorism! #fail RT  @FoxNews : Fort Hood shooter reportedly has drawn $278G in salary since massacre http://fxn.ws/16Mm7PR‚Äù
@FoxNews  disgraceful.
@FoxNews  Absolutely shameful. Who is he sending the money too? Money should be held in escrow. Call it "work place violence" DOJ. Not fooled.
@jagair  No, in order for him to be tried by the Army he has to be in the Army; hence, his pay status. He goes to Levenworth--worth it.:-)
@FoxNews  after all he has his rights, but Tea Partiers don't.
@FoxNews  um his pay should've been STOPPED!!!
wtf ?!?!?!?! Unreal !!!!
@foxnews  The huge salary the Fort Hood killer has accumulated is too shocking!  This isn't right!
SCANDAL #5 or it #6?
Our justice system
@FoxNews  Do they not answer to anyone?
@FoxNews  but it should certainly be suspended or paid back if found guilty. Those are tax payer dollars my friends.
this is just sad ...
this is bullshit!
This is messed up!
Ridiculous! No words.
Wait! What?!?!
@FoxNews  he needs to donate it to his victims; one way to save money..what has happened to morals
@FoxNews  How about unpaid leave until the result of the trail? That would be more suiting.
@FoxNews  you realize that should've read: $278K not G, right?
This is Pathetic!

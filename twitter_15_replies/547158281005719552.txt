@subaru_usa  Yeah this was when you still made awesome vehicles, not cookie cutter gas saving commuter-mobiles. My 2009 impreza was great.
@subaru_usa  Car stuck in SNOW gets TOTALED while being Pulled out: http://youtu.be/3PiGQMuT87U can you do this better?

@subaru_usa  It's a Dodge he's towing, they're useless all year round.
@subaru_usa  Wonder if he'll get a ticket next time in his WRX Impreza? #GetOutOfJailFree

@subaru_usa  lol hope he didn't get a  ticket for towing without a license or PSC (Public Service Commission) Kudos to Subaru
@subaru_usa  how about you build a police car? #blizzardof2015

@burg21  boycotting will change nothing. I am sorry. Zimmerman should not have followed him but trayvon should not have fought.
@PKA_FAN  @burg21  exactly . Black men always get arrested immediately. So why would it be made national? #UseYourBrain
@burg21  that is a rumor. You believe everything you see on the Internet?
@burg21  Thanks on my buy list now.
@burg21  @AnitaNelson   I  retweeted, will do whatever it takes
@burg21  @sdlaw2006  I have a strong feeling they were involved in this.
@burg21  @WkndGirl  Glad I use none of those....
@burg21  @MissSande  but what quality toliet paper am i gonna wipe my ass with ? Quilted northern is the best
@Applehead_aka  @burg21  @MissSande  This rumor isn't true. Koch did not fund Zimmerman's defense. More info on Snopes:
@burg21  and  @MarsGlobal  &  @DrinkAriZona ! Thank you for this info. Much appreciated
@burg21  Why were they paying GZ legal fees?! All for boycott, but I don't use any of their crap! #JusticeForTrayvon #JurorB37
@burg21  Just what is this supposed to prove/accomplish? Not guilty. Evidence in his favor, passed lie detector test. End of story.
@burg21  is this true i use almost everything on that list, im down for the boycott all they respond 2 is loss of $ #Zimmerman #TrayvonMartin
@burg21  Thanks..I will never purchase products or anything for that matter that supports that poor excuse for that cold hearted man.
@burg21  This rumor is completely untrue. Koch did not fund Zimmerman's defense. More info on Snopes -->

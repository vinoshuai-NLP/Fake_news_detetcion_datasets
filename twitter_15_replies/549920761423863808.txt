@LexyJa  @BuzzFeedNews  @BuzzFeed  Real Christians don't hate period, God is love. You are right, hate kills no matter what you believe in
@BuzzFeedNews   unfortunate someone with such passion was not giving the support they needed to blossom in her own way.
@BuzzFeedNews  @YadiraCorrea  wow, very sad
@BuzzFeedNews  talk about a stupid weak citizen. I hate gay transgendered kids. Let them rot in hell along with lesbians and gays
@BuzzFeedNews  that's also an ugly ass dress wtf was he thinking
@BuzzFeedNews  this is so so sad and should not be a solution for kids. Also, suicide is a very arrogant act. Only thinking about self.
@buildastarpromo  this is such an unbelievably ignorant statement to make, you clearly have no idea about suicide or suicidal feelings
. @BuzzFeedNews  ..."Fix Society?" I'm ok with that. Now will everyone join me in doing so?  @dyniace
@BuzzFeedNews  @madehanaqvi  what a waste.
@BuzzFeedNews  So devastating. 
@BuzzFeedNews  Only 17, society need 2 stop putting added stress on this girls n boys by telling them it's Ok 2 be something they're  not.
@BuzzFeedNews  @BuzzFeed  people theses day, transgender or not, all humans are human and they all have there rights society is getting worse
@BuzzFeedNews  @BuzzFeed  This is heartbreaking. I would hope that anyone who needs it will make use of the numbers at the end of the article.
@FukRacism  @BuzzFeedNews  Hate is a poison, nothing good comes of it.  Its what caused this in the first place
@BuzzFeedNews  good !
@BuzzFeedNews  coldplay says "fix you"
@BuzzFeedNews  @BuzzFeed  It's sad to think that her parent's couldn't love, value and accept the beautiful person she was.
@BuzzFeedNews  @BuzzFeed  Jeez people! Why can't we just accept that they can't help it?! This needs to stop!
@BuzzFeedNews  *16
@BuzzFeedNews  @BruiseAurora :(
@FukRacism  @BuzzFeedNews  you can do anything you want
@FukRacism  @BuzzFeedNews  It isn't based on hatred by a far shot, the actions of these narrow minded people are not Christian actions.
@FukRacism  @BuzzFeedNews  I realize religion has a bad rap, I see what you are saying.  His parents are terrible
@BuzzFeedNews  BEAUTIY SEXY
@BuzzFeedNews  @tyleroakley
@BuzzFeedNews  @BuzzFeed  we all really need to stop letting hate and misunderstanding change our ways of life   just be you... #LifeBeFree
@BuzzFeedNews   Ugh!  Get over it already.
“ @BuzzFeedNews : A Transgender 17-Year Old Left A Suicide Note On Tumblr Pleading "Fix Society" http://buzzfeed.com/jobarrow/a-transgender-17-year-old-left-a-suicide-note-on-tumblr-plea?bftw&utm_term=4ldqpgc#4ldqpgc…
@BuzzFeedNews  fuck im sad
@BuzzFeedNews  :(
@FukRacism  @BuzzFeedNews  Believe me I am too.  The main problem with it, it's interpreted by people.
@adoreist  @FukRacism  @batgirl2779  Pls don't use that word thank you
@sluttyseagull  @adoreist  @FukRacism  Thank you I agree, and where did this even come from
@FukRacism  a parent should accept their child no matter what and this family let self image and religion get ahead of that.
@BuzzFeedNews  @korybing  That mother though. Denying who her child was, denying what killed her. What a way to live. Unbelievable.
@FukRacism  she's just screaming at people apparently
@BuzzFeedNews  this broke my heart

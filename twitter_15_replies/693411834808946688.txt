@HuffingtonPost   who cares ??...
@HuffingtonPost  who cares what he wants
@HuffingtonPost  regardless it's bad casting. Man was black and should have a black actor playing him.
@HuffingtonPost  Well, it might have been smart for him to stay looking like a Black person!
@sremkusrenner Research vitiligo. Phototherapy is not that effective for widespread cases like MJ's...so no, he couldn't just "stay black"
@Steph_the_Weff  @sremkusrenner Oh please. It's obvious he wanted to be white. Don't make excuses for him.
@HuffingtonPost  That's okay - it's 2016 now
@HuffingtonPost  Why  not, he  wanted to  be  white
@HuffingtonPost  "it don't matter if you're black or white" - Michael Jackson
@HuffingtonPost  Errr, buy the time he died he was a middle aged white woman. Perhaps we should get Sandra Bullock to play him?
@HuffingtonPost  ...unless Carol Channing was available.
@senu01  @HuffingtonPost  Lol. So that's why he was white before he died?
@HuffingtonPost  such an insult!
@HuffingtonPost  @Zamalisa  We had invented make-up by then already. I remember it well.
@HuffingtonPost  He still didn't deal with the fact that if he looks white, shouldn't an actor playing him be white?
@HuffingtonPost  I believe that fair enough to Michael Jackson, anyone should be able to say who they want as an actor
@HuffingtonPost  so why is one playing him wtf

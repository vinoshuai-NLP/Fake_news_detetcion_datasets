Arrogant post! Oh, and you got the table wrong. Again. Olympic tables are based on golds, then silvers, then bronze.
HORRIBLE
ahhhh the arrogance of the septics
it never is when you cheat
so many salty people #haters #UsaNumber1
Only with the 5 best eurozone countries, EU has more golds than USA, with 50.
they had more athletes - I would have been a shame if the didn't win that many medals
We are the greatest country in the world.  Bye. RT  @espn : It wasn't even close.
UHHH, YA THINK?
You'd think oppressive China would be able to forcibly train more talented citizens out of their billion+ into Olympian champs.
maybe if you put your money into your homeless and sick, then you can be called winners #
no doubt. This goes back to talent and support.
yeah not bad for a massive country...
they mad
we should just round up of ALL the worlds best put them as 1 country and compete against the USA 
lol why so aggressive? Dudes just pointing out facts.
USA USA USA USA USA USA ALL DAY

well duh.
network hated on Olympics/Rio discouraging athletes/visitors.doubt same narrative if abc covered it.Olympics were great.
not arguing with you dude. Just pointing out that we always send more athletes.
granted but look at per capita rankings and the results may surprise.
it's great to have won but we did have more than 500 competitors so it should be expected.
stay humble.
a lot of athletes from other countries also live and train in US, then compete for their home nation. It could be worse.
richest nations on Earth win most medals. Shocked.
lol we owe China a ridiculous amount of debt....
Who the hell cares?
also a fact so get used to hearing it I guess. just pointing out that we SHOULD win medal count with the # of ppl we sent
to be fair we sent a shit ton more athletes than anyone else...
because a shit ton more athletes trained and qualified

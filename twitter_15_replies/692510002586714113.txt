@WhiteHouse  all we are Value
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  @IsraelinUSA  Yet he lets Isreal be terrorized. He is a liar. Past actions and current non actions prove that.
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  @IsraelinUSA  Agreed. But Israel dozes HOMES. That isn't justice or empathic of fellow humans. It's atrocious & hateful.

@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  @IsraelinUSA  that means you'll respond to the rise of Palestinian murders of innocent Israelis right?
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  @IsraelinUSA  when Christians are targeted for being Christians we must stand together n not look the other way
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  @IsraelinUSA  will you condemn palestinians murdering israelis in that case?

@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  @IsraelinUSA  When ANYONE is targeted for being different - we must respond together!
@WhiteHouse  @POTUS  @IsraelinUSA  why he does not say the same about muslims and palestinians or any other groups. It is really a puzzle.

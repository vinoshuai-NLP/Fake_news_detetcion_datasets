@HuffingtonPost  ...pls keep talking Trump.
@HuffingtonPost  really? can we stone adulterers too? Starting with him of course...
@HuffingtonPost  people on the private PRIVET app are having a hay day about this #trump #abortion #abortionstigma
@HuffingtonPost  My favorite part of this article is the Editor's Note. #MakeDonaldDrumpfAgain #MakeAmericaHateAgain
@HuffingtonPost  what?! Just when I thought Trump couldn't get much worse, he finds a way to surprise me. #Appalled
@HuffingtonPost  And where is the punishment for men that get the women pregnant
@HuffingtonPost  The moron is going to get badly scorched on this one he has just stuck his entire right hand in the fire!
@HuffingtonPost  He's trying to lose. He's realised he's too close for comfort & has neither policy, depth nor cojones to go the distance.
@HuffingtonPost  why do people pretend this is not what Cruz and Kasich ultimately want. they too seek to ban abortion.
@HuffingtonPost  did the trump chump Botox his brain, too? #punishhim
@lotrob14  @HuffingtonPost  I said that too a long while ago. It is possible.
@HuffingtonPost  just when you think your opinion of DT couldn't be any lower he proves me wrong. Reprehensible  @realDonaldTrump  #NeverTrump
@HuffingtonPost  @JessDolac  please read this!
@HuffingtonPost  the media
@HuffingtonPost  There should have been "some form of punishment" for his mother NOT aborting him.
@jenniferpherris  @HuffingtonPost  what I was gonna say
@HuffingtonPost  omg.  It never ends and I never stop being shocked
@lotrob14  At the risk of his own (albeit miniscule) integrity? Who hates Republicans THAT much --to go down in history like that?
@HuffingtonPost   It was just a matter of time for him to hit the self destruct button and alienate moderate Republicans from his base.
@HuffingtonPost  What do you expect from a DICK like Trump. Women suppressing, hypocrite. Why he married immigrant. Strong women scare him.
@HuffingtonPost  dude is pretty much advocating sharia law and these numbskulls still will bow to him. #MullahDrumpf
@HuffingtonPost  well They're terminating the life of their child. They punish anyone that would even attempt to take someone's life
@HuffingtonPost  Not a fan of Drumpf but use the proper context. IF IILEGAL = WHAT PUNISHMENT. That was the question.
@HuffingtonPost  oh for the love of fuck, I could push him off a cliff and not feel a flicker of emotion 
@HuffingtonPost  @realDonaldTrump
@HuffingtonPost  Keep it up Donald. Pretty soon you'll piss off not just women but Democrats, and most sane people.
“ @HuffingtonPost : Donald Trump goes full anti-woman: "punishment" for women who abort http://huff.to/1TjayHg ” 
@HuffingtonPost  No more Trouble Trump, Please.

@NHLBlinn  @Steve_Dangle  For any of those #Leafs fans and bandwagoners who want to jump off for good, this is your chance!
“ @NHLBlinn : Report: TOR, Seattle, Q City to join Vegas in 2017 NHL expansion: http://ow.ly/ALe1Z” and you get a team, & you get a team!

@NHLBlinn  @felixpotvin  Wow...you mean Toronto may in fact get a NHL team finally?
“ @NHLBlinn : Report: Toronto, Seattle, Quebec City to join Vegas in 2017 NHL expansion: http://ow.ly/ALe1Z” holy crap!
@NHLBlinn  @Pitty_Da_Fool  whoa really #NHL is watered down enough as it is already. Adding another 104 more players who aren't NHLers is bad!
@NHLBlinn  @Pitty_Da_Fool  correction that's an additional 92 players not 104. Still half asleep!!

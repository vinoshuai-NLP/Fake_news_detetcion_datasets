@BBCBreaking  @BBCWorld  tell us something new
@BBCBreaking  Absolute state of some of the yanks using this tragedy to try and justify their own gun laws. Couldn't make it up.
@MurrayTCDouglas yes everyone knows Wikipedia is full of facts.
@BBCBreaking  @pargrl68  @BBCWorld  this can't be! #Obama said this doesn't happen in other countries. #NRA #guncontrol
@Bowtimeready  @BBCBreaking  @pargrl68  @BBCWorld  he said it didn't happen with the same frequency, which is true...
@MurrayTCDouglas  very good so guns kill less people than knives and 'other' objects. Worth knowing.
@MurrayTCDouglas I won't
@MurrayTCDouglas like, totally.
@MurrayTCDouglas what's your source for "the alarming regularity and numbers" of shootings in the USA vs the world? Or was that BS?
@MurrayTCDouglas lol, exact same stats except using a 1:100,000 model.
@MurrayTCDouglas how about total violent crime? Canada at 2.1, US at 2.8.  And that includes guns lol.
@MurrayTCDouglas Just showing that violence is going to happen regardless of gun ownership. And 2.1 is not 1/3 of 2.8 even in Canada.

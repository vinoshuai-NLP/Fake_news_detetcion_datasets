@WIRED  I lived in Chapel Hill and one of our teachers explained this to us. This districting is actually the best way for minorities
@WIRED  to actually have say in politics and if it was districted otherwise it would actually result in less say from them
@PapaOfTheFlock  @WIRED  Teacher was wrong. They have a vote. But the other side has many votes. And assurances of re-election.
@WIRED  Love that word, gerrymandering (but dislike the concept)
@WIRED  I live in a gerry-mandered district that looks sane compared to this
@WIRED  Mapping out the soon to come racial revolution!!!
@WIRED  Fantastic!
@WIRED  "...sometimes cities have to take ethnicity into account."  And, right there, the article refutes itself.
@WIRED  @stacyherbert  .......Gerrymandering keeps the NRA happy.
@WIRED  @GreatDismal  Ah crap, I can see my house of representatives on there.
@WIRED  problem with fixing gerrymandering is that it benefits both parties  @primatemachine
@WIRED  @peterwsinger  Maryland's too: esp 2,3,4,7,8  http://ow.ly/XEHmf
@WIRED  @AntonyGreenABC  Every time I see these salamanders I become more infuriated and less sure that Congress can ever be representative.
@WIRED  The number 12 has to be printed at an angle because no part of the district is wide enough on the map to accommodate it.
@elektrotal  Ah, home... and also a bunch of places I've never been near, in the same district.  @WIRED

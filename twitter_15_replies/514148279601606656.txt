@mashable  Ireland Guinness or American Guinness? Huge difference
I'd rather have an actual Guinness  @mashable
@mashable  I think this will do well. They already make coffee that reportedly tastes like coffee.

@AsianSweetieOrg  @Clarketacular LMAO!
@Clarketacular  @AsianSweetieOrg  I hate to admit it but something of a lightweight when it comes to beer - prefer lagers like Heineken.
@AsianSweetieOrg  @Clarketacular I liked The Usual Suspects and House but not much else.
@Clarketacular  @AsianSweetieOrg  Guinness is too filling (aka fattening). Too much like a liquid meal.
Intrigued! RT @mashable : Starbucks is experimenting with a beer-flavored latte that reportedly tastes like Guinness http://on.mash.to/1r1fBz4
@mashable  hmmm.. I like my latte tasting latte and my beer tasting beer 
@Clarketacular  @AsianSweetieOrg  Shiner Bock is not too bad. Used to like dark beers like Michelob dark. But the last few years mostly lager

@mashable  Bravo SB but we don't need a Guinness flavored Coffee Drink as much as we need Guinness with espresso! A Shot in the Brew anyone?

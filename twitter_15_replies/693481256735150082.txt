@BBCWorld ! You jumped on this story in 24 hours, yet when 800+ women were sexually assaulted by migrants u waited 5 full days #bias #lies
@BBCWorld  citationstecken?! #bra
@lion00713  @BBCWorld  @BBCNews  Do you know for definite they were'nt. Also regardless beating up innocents does not solve the issue
@HayleyK1989  @BBCWorld  @BBCNews  of course people from thought the Middle East , and North Africa are not the same ethnic origin.
@ADK_Drifter that is factually incorrect. Sharia is a set of laws.
@ADK_Drifter  @BBCWorld  Switch "Muslim" for followers of any other religion, the same is true.   Smearing many with actions of few - V stupid
@ADK_Drifter Sigh.
@BBCWorld  the criminal (Assad chemical) bombed the camps in the countryside of Latakia !! ?? Is stayed humanitarian
@ADK_Drifter pull up your pants, would ya?
@ADK_Drifter so a minority of all Muslim men globally. Thanks for confirming.
@BBCWorld  @phasmasam  so much for wanted to live in Sweden because it's so progressive 
@ReignTrain  gotta love the white supremacists... #NetherlandsOrBust?
@BBCWorld  The other kind of homegrown terrorists.
@bbcworld  cowards thugs  bullies
@BBCWorld  @BBCNews  Not slow to report this are they? How's the reporting going over there, imagine they are not pretending it did'nt happen?
@BBCWorld  right or wrong there will be backlash. Politicians play this chess reactive not proactive
@BBCWorld  I.E: help refugees before they leave...difficult yes...this new bs difficult yes?
@ADK_Drifter you're suggesting they're all the same which is impossible to generalise. I just fundamentally disagree, sorry.
@BBCWorld  @BankersDidIt  ...always "wearing masks"
@BBCWorld  Amazing how they show protests against Muslims but not Muslims protesting against Christians
@BBCWorld  @BBCNews   Good for them!!!!!! Send those pukes back where the came from!!
@BBCWorld  @Natalie91231732   This will get worse as young migrants continue do not understand Western values & attitudes to women
@BBCWorld  there is already an imbalance in the male/female ration in Sweden, yet they wonder if bringing in thousands of males would matter?
@BBCWorld  @BBCNews  and this I'm afraid is just the begining.
@BBCWorld  Nazi badboys.
@BBCWorld  s/masked men/neo-nazis/ - and those supporting them need to recognise the real enemy is not the refugee but the tax-evading fatcat
@ADK_Drifter  @creamofgold  You worked in a prison, with criminals. I work with Muslims who are not criminals, so have an opposing viewpoint.
@ADK_Drifter Anyone who has read either interprets each. There is no one true view on any religious text.
@ADK_Drifter There are way more than two types of Muslims. But either way, your viewpoint is a personal one.
@ADK_Drifter Why?
@BBCWorld  @_Pedantica  why "migrant attack" it is or it's not
@ADK_Drifter I've read parts of it & dislike parts of it, as I dislike parts of (especially) the Old Testament, which sanctions rape. But...
@ADK_Drifter  @ttownorso  What?
@ADK_Drifter  @ttownorso  Ridiculous.
@ADK_Drifter  @creamofgold  @BBCWorld  There's no such thing as permissible. Someone has interpreted the laws.

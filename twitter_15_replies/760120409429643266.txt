Saul Alinsky: ‚Äú7. Remove the belief of God from the Government and Schools.‚Äù http://fromthetrenchesworldreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/12112357_1066302156715778_4293103776881640390_n-560x391.jpeg‚Ä¶
Have the After School Satan clubs. It will expose backers. And, hold them to same standards.
The Constitution of the United States is based on Christianity which many people have tried to eliminate! God is mentioned.
The Constitution of the United States does not mention satan only the Lord God the Creator not the prideful fallen angel!
Proverbs 22:6 That is what the parents should do Rev Franklin Graham just like your dad did that to you,Amen
I don't believe either exists... But...
I saw you in Wikipedia on your dad how is coping with Parkinson's decease it can be cured 1Peter2:24 By Jesus Stripeshealed
He can come wherever he likes, but please avoid our faces and hair. It's hard to clean off.
One person praying can do more good than a hundred complaining.
. @Franklin_Graham if Christians can use your imaginary friend #god to spread BS~they can use your imaginary enemy satan to spread thinking
I will pray and in agreement with you franklin in JESUS HOLY NAME HALLEUJAH JESUS IS Lord
Prayer sent. üïá
Recorded deaths in the Bible, Satan-10 God-2,476,633 (not including flood, plagues, etc.) WHOSE goal is destruction????
You'd assume, but the likes of The Satanic Temple are atheistic, invoking Satan as a rebel against religion.
So now it's okay for schools to discriminate based on religious beliefs? Gotcha!
why?
So you agree that our public schools shouldn't have any religious events? Or you need to read the Constitution?
Imaginary friends&supernatural are not SomeOne... at least for rational people. @Kecjmc  @Franklin_Graham
There are thousands of gods and religions making that claim. Are they all correct and Supernatural? @Kecjmc  @Franklin_Graham
From reason alone the supernatural is imaginary and not real. Reason dictate natural is real @Kecjmc  @Franklin_Graham
The honest answer is NOT to assume, its to say I Don't Know until there is Evidence! Not conjecture @Kecjmc  @Franklin_Graham
When humans want to know,we use scientific method.. not prayer,conjecture,wishes,psychics..or god of the Gaps B/C they Fail.
Well unfortunately philosophical reasoning doesn't consistently lead to facts, scientic method does @Kecjmc  @Franklin_Graham
1. Ex.When my Ex-husband told me he loved me then beat me,I used scientific method to determine hes lying. results mattered!
Determining the meaning of life is not a fact...its an opinion we each form for ourselves...just like religion...
Love is a Feeling(brain) or Actions or both..depending on person.Its measurable&can be falsified with the SM, no woo needed.
Me too...Thank you.
What do you mean small world?I live in the same world you do...traveled the world...met thousands..loved many..gave birth :)
Well Id say facts don't care if Im happy.Im honest about reality&people.My happiness is not hinged on lies&wishful thinking.
Id never want any1 to settle for..to be happy I must believe lies&myth r real.Theres to much real beauty to settle for that!
Oh I didn't realize this was a "fight" :(. I appreciate ur honesty&inquiry.Id call it whatever who discovers it to be real..
The problem is"power","mover","transcendent","god","philosophical reasoning" is the same as "imaginary friend"at this point.
If I could I would **HUG** you. Much love :)
that's not how the law works dude. I'm Canadian and I even know that.

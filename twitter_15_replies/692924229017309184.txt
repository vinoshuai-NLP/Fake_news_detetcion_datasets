@FAngelQ  I'm moderate (which Right calls Left and Left calls Right) & 4 anything that keeps spotlight off biggest clown, but you're right.
@Slate  @NoThoughtsHere  @SenTedCruz  no one likes him! no one! arrogance is something no one wants to deal with!
. @Slate  @NoThoughtsHere  This was perhaps the most human & genuine moment of the evening. I will never support  @SenTedCruz  but this was cruel
@CaptainAlex8  @Slate  @NoThoughtsHere  @SenTedCruz  Cruel? Remember this?
@Slate   so blatant...he doesn't  like him for sure.
@Slate  I've watched this entirely too many times and it still makes me smile
@Slate  - If you ran your little video a tad further, you'd see that he and Bush did end up engaging in a friendly conversation.
@FAngelQ  @Slate  Lighten up, Frances.
@Slate  Low class snub by  @JebBush  ignoring  @tedcruz . Establishment wishes Cruz would go away. @TexasCruzn  @DLoesch  @rickwtyler  @THETXEMBASSY
@Slate  Real high-class politicians, aren't they??
@Slate    They will fit right in----- in Washington!

@WhiteHouse  coverage. That does NIT mean they can afford CARE. Again you LIE. #nohillary2016  #repealobamacare
@WhiteHouse  FACT: I haven't seen my $2000 reduction in premiums you promised. #grubered
@pinecohen  @WhiteHouse  I have ZERO deductible on Horizon Omnia platinum for $300 a month.. 90 percent costs covered
@WhiteHouse  Fact: My family with two working adults can no longer afford coverage provided by employer.
@ted_thomson54  @WhiteHouse  thank you Ted!! I am also curious.
@WhiteHouse  @potus  that is great that even those that already have an illness won't be denied coverage-blessings
@WhiteHouse  FACT: Bears eat beets! Bears beets battlestar galactica
@WhiteHouse  I think Healthcare has gotten better, but it does have things in it that needs fixed, 1. Nobody should be fined because
@WhiteHouse  they can't afford it
@WhiteHouse  I was denied. Who do I see now?
@WhiteHouse  Too bad we still can't afford it!!!! I would love to share my hshld exp. vs incm with you, you show me how!!!
@pinecohen  @WhiteHouse  if those states followed the rules and expanded coverage in 2014, there would be no issues!
@WhiteHouse  believe it or not twenty years ago, remember when insurance premiums were reasonable and max out of pocket costs were low.
@WhiteHouse  also remember when insurance was affordable for low income workers.  Today lower cost is hidden by higher deductibles.
@pinecohen  @WhiteHouse  Republican governors refused to comply with the law and scewed over their citizens! Look at KY and Louisiana
@pinecohen  @WhiteHouse  300-400k people lose Medicaid because of failed leadership
@pinecohen  @WhiteHouse  thankfully the new Dem Governor of Louisiana reinstated the funding
@pinecohen  @WhiteHouse  I'm a student and I get some help from parents but loans cover my tuition. And I can still afford the $300 a month HC
@WhiteHouse  only about 3 million can afford it
@WhiteHouse  fact, hard working people now paying for themselves, paying more and taxed higher for those not working #Obamacare #broken
@WhiteHouse  And illegal aliens.
@WhiteHouse  Great! What can you do for millions of seniors not old enough for Medicare when their insurance goes up 40% w/ no COLA increase?
@WhiteHouse  that is over 30% of the population this is just more Obama BS that makes no sense are people that stupid to beleive this
@WhiteHouse  the president don't know his math
. @WhiteHouse  Obamacare will continue its coverage in years to come as the huge job of changing to single payer healthcare begins #BernieCare
@WhiteHouse  Rather pay the fine, would be cheaper.
@WhiteHouse  With a 4,000 dollar deductible what's the benefit?

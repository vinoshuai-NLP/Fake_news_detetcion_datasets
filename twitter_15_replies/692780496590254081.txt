@espn  how do you know it was on purpose.. Maybe the kid with Down syndrome won cuz he's good chumps
@espn  Ive known the kid almost his whole life. Not surprised because he is a good guy from a good family. Classy move Dev!
@espn  Old School and lovin it!
@espn  As a diabled atheleate myself, we dont want people to let us win. Try your best agaist us. treat us the same as any other wrestler
@SeanKelemen  @PF402  @Ballzac527  @SUKnives  @espn  What's wrong with "lost on purpose"? That's exactly what happened.
@cujoknows  @SeanKelemen  @Ballzac527  @SUKnives  @espn  the whole point is so give the kid a sense of accomplishment, and wording it as they did
@espn  sad
@espn  that guy "gets it". It's not all about winning. 
@espn  kinda sucks he got the kid in the match to mess his record up but hey good for him.
@espn  i have an opinion and not sure how to express it...
@espn  first class kid.
@espn  @TRingland  jake the snake diversified?
@espn  great to see true sportsmanship
@cujoknows  @Hay_sully  @Joeey_Only  @espn  it's called being a nice person clearly you guys have never heard of that
@cujoknows  @Hay_sully  @Joeey_Only  @espn  you're so ignorant it makes me cringe
@tomatokiller14  @cujoknows  @Joeey_Only  @espn  he is I agree
@espn  link doesn't open
@espn  not a sport.
@cujoknows  @tomatokiller14  @Hay_sully  @Joeey_Only  @espn  the worst part about people that don't get it: they don't get that they don't get it
@ganttensend  I see, read it the wrong way.
@cujoknows  I fail to see how that has anything to do with this, but good try I guess
@espn   It's the thought that counts ,made that kid feel like a  big winner, !!
@cujoknows  explain to me how I'm being a hypocrite?
@cujoknows  no I was just telling you to have a fucking heart instead of bashing the kid
@espn  class act! Well done!
@cujoknows   someone getting salty?
@TRingland  I'll be dipping into your territory when you get back tonight you saucy little minx
@CoachVitelli  @magnificenn  @PF402  @SeanKelemen  @Ballzac527  @SUKnives  @espn  Not doubting that. Kid also got some amazing pub!
@CoachVitelli  @magnificenn  @PF402  @SeanKelemen  @Ballzac527  @SUKnives  @espn  Nothing wrong with that. I'm sure he deserves it.
@espn  Honerable kid. A selfless act of kindness.
@espn  Takes a good person to do something like this, an a good sport, he deserves a little credit, an not disrespect.
@SamxMcDonald  @espn  its bonkers
@espn  that's cool.
@espn  this is a true winner when you make someone's life goal come true just buy letting a little bit of your pride go
@espn  @nicbradley21
@kyle_shrider  @espn  saaammmee

In her honor, I pledge to use the word "critters" more often. MT  @Variety : Donna Douglas, Elly May on ‘Beverly Hillbillies,’ Dies at 81
@Variety  Awwwww no.  RIP Ellie Mae Clampett, you will be missed!
@Variety  @JosephMcGann  Sad news, the Beverly Hillbillies is about the first US one I remember. Sitcom, that is
@Variety  As sad as her death is the fact that she was never able to let go of the character of Elly May; Even at the age of 75 and more.
@Variety  I wouldn't call Elly May 'ditsy'. She was a strong woman who could outwrassle and outshoot men, while looking gorgeous all the time

@Variety   I was so lucky to talk to her only 2 months ago for my blog, she was a sweet, kind and generous lady. http://retroladyland.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/you-can-take-girl-out-of-south.html…

@USATODAY  Good Ol' Boy system at work just like 1865.
@USATODAY  New police chief?
@USATODAY  The #Ferguson police department is incompetent. Why would you give 12 hours notice of releasing the officers name? Builds hype
@USATODAY  BTW the interview the #Ferguson Police Chief conducted yesterday was the worst interview I have ever seen
RT  @USATODAY : Name of #Ferguson cop is expected to be released by 9 ET http://usat.ly/1oAadlh (J.B. Forbes, AP) ‚Äù
@USATODAY  Get ready to tweet the address #SpikeLee and other vigilantes .

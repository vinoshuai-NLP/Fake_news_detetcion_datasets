@SplatsReads  @NBCNews  I agree it isn't robbery its simple shoplifting an assult

@NBCNews   Let me the guess the cops made him commit the robbery... The people that are rioting and looting look like idiots #Ferguson
@His_SmokingGun  @NBCNews  bull still don't have no weapon dickheads & that's not him
@NBCNews  are they saying that he was involved or just fit description. I don't think that's him.
@NBCNews  another example of the media forwarding the narrative of the police/state.
@NBCNews   shame on you NBC NEWS...people are trying to heal...besides we can't see this person's face...could be anyone>STOP DIVIDING PEOPLE
@EBONYMag    check out what >  @NBCNews   is tweeting...The young man doesn't have a record but NBC News is tweeting this, dividing people more
So, he really was a thug? RT  @NBCNews : Photos of robbery involving Michael Brown in #Ferguson http://nbcnews.to/XmXS8V
@jimbroadhead  @NBCNews  Why haven't the police released the actual shooting incident.  Shooting someone who has surrendered is murder.

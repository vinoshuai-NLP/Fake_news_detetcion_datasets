@espn  Trumps LA Rams. Brilliant.
@espn  PLEASE
@espn  it's a joke just another pawn in a lengthy and drama filled saga
@espn  WOW Perfect Hollywood stars nudies http://bit.ly/1KdhOBR (Las Las Vegas ) https://pic.twitter.com/OPeS7NsDbo
@espn  ok this is just getting silly.
@espn  no.
@espn  hell no
@espn  no.
@espn  god, what's next? ... all of the sudden two NFL teams in LA? 
@espn  Um, Wut?
@espn  is that #Kenanandkel
@AtomicMexican  but its fun to talk about.
@espn  @luckykidtay  
@espn  Makes financial sense. Have slots and tables in the arena to help pay for the stadium. Each concession will have Keno and slots. 
@john11rob  @espn  u right
@espn  as a vegas resident this would be a welcome addition!  #LASVEGASRAIDERS!!
@espn  you guys can talk about the Las Vegas Raiders after you beat the Cam Newton comments into the ground for another 56 minutes
@espn  San Antonio Raiders sounds much better!
@espn  they could use a team.  They have the money in that area.
@espn  this guy would be at one of their games each year http://gofundme.com/cewkmyyc
@espn  Why not move every team and rip the heart of every city?? The NFL is about money over fans.
@espn  I can only imagine what the cheerleaders costumes will look like
@espn  naw bro, they tried this before, how did that work out for them? The Silver, and Black belongs to Oakland to the end
@espn  No one deserves the Raiders more than Las Vegas.
@espn  just make a decision already !
@espn  #Raiders2LV
@KidColorway  @espn  it's pretty clear Davis does not give a shit about keepin is in the Bay.. Sad. & right by the Vegas strip sounds stupid
@CruzPedregon  @espn  Great! They can have em'!

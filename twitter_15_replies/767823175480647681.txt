@mike_pence  jeez politico at least spell his quote correctly
@mike_pence  but we need to check your birth control pills because.. Jesus said so
Who thinks #Trump would do anything for anyone that owed him $400,000,000 ? NOT me. This is another #Trumpence FARCE!
Well we are not doing that now anyway. I can see why Trump and Co prefer the uneducated who will fall for that crap of yours!!
I see Pence is spreading lies too. He's no better than Drumpf.
Unqualified to hold any office
but will u personally pay all the small businesses  @realDonaldTrump  has stiffed as a great businessman?? U sold your soul, Pence.
Make America great again!
He Will only bankrupt the country, and then give themselves a nice raise. #DumpTrump
@mike_pence  gary Johnson needs to get his rump out of the race
All-righty then, I'm glad he cleared that up.
From the New GOP Dictionary: RANSOM - n., (RAN-sum) paying another what you owe them. #iranransomscandal
@mike_pence  @realDonaldTrump  paying ransoms to known sponsors of terror and enemies of US is TREASON... ARTICLE III IMPEACH OBAMA
Preach it Mr. Pence!!
hevwill never , ever, ever, be president
The GOP echo chamber:  @mike_pence  repeats "ransom" for Trump-bots when unfreezing assets belonging to Iran means "giving it back."
I'm sure you'll think twice if it's your son they are threatening to chop off his headThen you'll make some excuse to get him home
when is politico going to talk about the Clinton foundation corruption
no cos we will be bankrupt or at war from brainless  @realDonaldTrump
But we didn't do that now but why the truth get in the way of a good lie.
We shouldn't be paying ransom now!!
Don't worry Pence, neither of you will be in the WH. #NeverTrump #TrumpLies #Unfit4POTUS
@mike_pence  Are we going to let children smoke and a national religion? Women's rights not constitutional?
no cause only Blondes will be accepted in his country!
@OmaTalley1  That's exactly Right and we'll get our ppl held captured back too.
@mike_pence  I like Mike
So they're going to continue with current policy,  then? #gop #dnc #POTUS
cuz Americans who "get caught" aren't heroes & worth getting back? Who will U pay ransom 2, good guys?  @SenJohnMcCain  @mike_pence
@mike_pence  Mikey, on Nov 8, you will be relegated to political oblivion
@mike_pence  @realDonaldTrump  will NEVER become president. He is not qualified to be POTUS. #NeverTrump
TRUMP BACKS OFF IMMIGRATION BAN
@mike_pence   That's right  #NeverHillary   #MakeAmericaGreatAgain   #TrumpPence16

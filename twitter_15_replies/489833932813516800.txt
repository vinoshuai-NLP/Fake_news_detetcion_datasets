@prchovanec  @washingtonpost  If a sophisticated SAM strike(w/radar), doesn't US have capability to monitor heat signatures at launch, etc?

@washingtonpost   Is this another "wag the dog ops "? As WaPo poster says, this sytem can ping transponder and know it was civilian , so?
@washingtonpost  It isn't. This is a random Russian Buk-M2 (SA-17), not the Buk-M1 (SA-11).

@washingtonpost  @ukrpravda_news  in 2001, the Ukrainians have already shot down a civilian plane! And now rocketed not there!
@washingtonpost  Why did the #Fireball Originate on #Ground #Impact? if a #missile was used ? then why was NO Fireball in the AIR ? REALLY?
@washingtonpost  @ralphriegel  This is basically an upgraded SA-6 which has been around for decades. Used in Yom Kippur  war '73.
@donlav  @washingtonpost    That's why you were worth bullion on the news desk! Tragic story in Donetsk. Interesting what Putin does next.
@AlexanderNero  Both actually confirm that #DNR has working SAMs on "strategic sites."
@washingtonpost  if it was a missile the plane would explode in the sky, but it's not. So don't say nonsense. Not all people are stupid!

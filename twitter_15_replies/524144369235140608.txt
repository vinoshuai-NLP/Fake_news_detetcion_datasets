@latest_is  @glinner  Nothing on website of either  @metpoliceuk  or  @citypolice  - sure about this?
@latest_is  @Glinner  They had me going for a bit, at least until the introduction of "Fappy" :-)
@latest_is  @zirnazolle Agora sim: com a prisão de Bansky, me sinto vivendo num mundo mais seguro.
@latest_is  @glinner  this had gotta be a fake. The police chief they mention, for example.
@latest_is  @Glinner  Nope. That site is just click bait. The guy is an employee and the arrest pic is from the last riots.
@engstromx  @Glinner  @latest_is  so it's not true ????
@latest_is  @jeffparker  Definitely a fake since there's nothing in the UK papers about this whatsoever.
@DanCarpenter85  @latest_is  And the bit about Fappy! :: )
@latest_is  @Glinner  ugh, not remotely funny. Try the  @WhispersNewsLTD  for piss taking / satire, that's actually funny
@latest_is  @SamhainNight  Hoax. :p
@JoametteGil  Oh good!
@cameronMstewart  @latest_is  Cheers!
@duncanfegredo  @cameronMstewart  @latest_is  National report stories are all fiction.
@cameronMstewart  @duncanfegredo  @latest_is  the part about Fappy the Dolphin is 100% true though!
@jeffparker  @cameronMstewart  @duncanfegredo  @latest_is  I love the idea of a dolphin as an anti-masturbation mascot. T-Rex would work too..
WHAT?! Hope it's a hoax! “ @latest_is  Graffiti Artist #Banksy Arrested In London,Identity Revealed| National Report http://nationalreport.net/banksy-arrested-identity-revealed/…”
@lily_218  @latest_is  Hoax I would think. What charges?
@latest_is  I am Banksy
@latest_is  @mattbean1  or is it a Hoax? http://independent.co.uk/news/people/banksy-arrest-hoax-internet-duped-by-fake-report-claiming-that-the-street-artists-identity-has-been-revealed-9806157.html…
@n0tice  @latest_is  so it is! Exit through the gift shop, please...
@latest_is  @duncanfegredo  knight him!

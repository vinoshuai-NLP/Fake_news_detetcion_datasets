@GangstaFem  @Reuters  theyl're expected to get some right. Putin, Ukraine, migrants, austerity,  Turkey, nstream2, Crimea. She got all wrong.
@gloria_poole  That all depends on your idea of what 'good' is. It is entirely possible that Germany descends into anarchy because of her.
@Reuters   I strongly agree that this women sell by date passed.#Merkel made a mess out of #Europe.
@Reuters  60% wish she'd drop dead
@Reuters  to expect a leader to resign every time a choice doesn't pan out the way we hope is unrealistic.
@Reuters  - she needs to pay the price for her arrogance, she was warned re imbalance of gender/religion/culture. Madness!
@Reuters  What does it say about Germans if 40% wants to punish #angelamerkel for being kind to fellow humans in need. 60% Majority thank you
@TJEbah  @Reuters  It just says that not all German's are willing to pay for a bunch of criminals.
@Reuters  .... Where are their vaunted Neo Natzis?????
@Reuters  The opposition to her is growing week by week.
@Reuters  WTF is wrong with the other 60%?
@Reuters  She's the de facto leader of EU as the lights go out on the European Project. Her record is abysmal and the damage is irreparable.
@Reuters  WTH?
@Reuters  ..really?
@Reuters  welcome to terrorist groups
@Reuters  Sew that coming.
@Reuters   Wonderful lady
@Reuters  which means %60 dont. so the MAJORITY of people do NOT want her to resign.
@Reuters   I would tend to agree.
@Reuters .And Obama wants to adopt the same Merkel policies on refuges to destroy America.we need to stop these reckless policies vote Trump
@Reuters  Merkel opened the flood gates to something she didn't understand. She failed-it's time to say goodbye.
@Reuters  so few ???
@Reuters  #k√∂lnhbf Germans in coalition with EU not willing to tolerate a migration policy that opposes EU values, culture & German laws!
@Reuters  She has done well why should she resign
@Reuters  Does that mean that 60% want her to stay
@Reuters  @ButlerUKIP leave now you moronic excuse of a human being,traitor to the German people and the whole of Europe!
@Reuters  not a good idea at all long life Angella!!
@Reuters  Well she won't. She is never wrong. Like another leader they had. Why don't the Germans just DO something. Don't they ever learn?
@Reuters  So the majority supports her!

@Reuters  that funny I thought it would be more like 70% of German wants her to resign over the refugee deads and her open doors Europe.
@Reuters  #Islamophobia
@Reuters  so 60% are happy with her, right. a very little number of statesmen are handling situations like these EU is facing that serious.
@Reuters  @Silver_Watchdog  it should be 98%
@Reuters  German applauded #Hitler's policy of mass murder and they are dissatisfied with #Merkel mass saving lives.

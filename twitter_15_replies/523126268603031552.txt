@majornelson  are they the biggest spider or is it the huntsman spider?
@majornelson  looks like the spider is in the foreground a considerable (and sizeable), amount.
@majornelson   is it just me or does sticking my hand within 3 meters of that things seem stupid let alone 3 inches, random rainforest spider
@majornelson  Sounds like one hell of a Spiderman origin story
@thevowel  @majornelson  just be thankful it is not as big as YOUR puppy.
@thevowel  @majornelson  You can't deny that it's pretty amazing.
@majornelson  KAMEHAMEHA!!!!!!
@majornelson  Kill it with so much fire that future generations of spiders fear even so much as a spark.

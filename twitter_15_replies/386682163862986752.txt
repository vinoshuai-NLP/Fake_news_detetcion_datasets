@mmfa  doesn't matter, 75% of their viewers will believe it forever.
@dno253  @mmfa  that's the sad thing.
@mmfa  Fox=Idiots
@mmfa  All Muslims are not our enemy and Fox wonders why Christians are killed in the middle east. How can U expect thm not to hate if We do?
#DOLTS RT  @mmfa : Fox: Obama offers "to pay out of his own pocket for the museum of Muslim culture." Their source: A satire website
@mmfa  Vote to SHUTDOWN the GOP in 2014! Bumper sticker avail. 10/21 http://r.ebay.com/mXITy9
@mmfa  lol and they call themselves news with a straight face
@mmfa  AFAIK, Science is the human endeavor with the highest standard of evidence; punditry (Fox News in particular) seems the opposite.
@mmfa    I almost feel guilty laughing at the  @foxandfriends  dolts. Almost.
Stupid Fux  @mmfa   @FoxNews

@mmfa  @Truthbuster   @edshow   Same source: T Cruz is Cuban citizen and not Canadian! Sent to US as spy by Castro! @ringoffireradio
@john9880  @mmfa  @edshow  @ringoffireradio He produced a Canadian birth certificate. I didn't see his US citizen records...did you?
I seriously doubt if anyone at faux "News" is capable of discerning what is satire or not.   @mmfa
